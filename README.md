# Diffusion-Project

In this project, we propose a system to generate illustrations for paragraphs from the books in a specific style based on their genres to make boring novels in our literature, interesting. The pipeline of the system consists of three main parts: a knowledge distillation-based informa- tion retrieval model to summarize a given para- graph, a clustering model to figure out the genre of the input, and fine-tuned stable diffusion model to generate an image from a paragraph summary given special style, which depends on the genre.

I deleted initial dataset 'books_and_genres.csv' since it weights 3GB.

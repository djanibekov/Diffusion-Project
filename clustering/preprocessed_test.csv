4654,"""Well, Mr. Benedict,"" retorted Captain Hull, ""another had said that long before Sir John Franklin"". ""Another""? ""Yes; and that other was Uncle Toby"". ""An entomologist""? asked Cousin Benedict, quickly. ""No! Sterne's Uncle Toby, and that worthy uncle pronounced precisely the same words, while setting free a mosquito that annoyed him, but which he thought himself at liberty to _thee_ and _thou_: 'Go, poor devil,' he said to it, 'the world is large enough to contain us, thee and me!

4655,"""I believe so, indeed,"" retorted Captain Hull, gravely, ""as he has never existed""! And each began to laugh, looking at Cousin Benedict. Thus, then, in these conversations, and many others, which invariably bore on some point of entomological science, whenever Cousin Benedict took part, passed away long hours of this navigation against contrary winds. The sea always fine, but winds which obliged the schooner to tack often. The ""Pilgrim"" made very little headway toward the east--the breeze was so feeble; and they longed to reach those parts where the prevailing winds would be more favorable. It must be stated here that Cousin Benedict had endeavored to initiate the young novice into the mysteries of entomology. But Dick Sand had shown himself rather refractory to these advances. For want of better company the savant had fallen back on the negroes, who comprehended nothing about it. Tom, Acteon, Bat, and Austin had even finished by deserting the class, and the professor found himself reduced to Hercules alone, who seemed to him to have some natural disposition to distinguish a parasite from a thysanuran. So the gigantic black lived in the world of coleopteras, carnivorous insects, hunters, gunners, ditchers, cicindelles, carabes, sylphides, moles, cockchafers, horn-beetles, tenebrions, mites, lady-birds, studying all Cousin Benedict's collection, not but the latter trembled on seeing his frail specimens in Hercules' great hands, which were hard and strong as a vise.",test,0,3,0,believe indeed retorted gravely never existed began laugh looking conversations many others invariably bore point entomological science whenever took part passed away long hours navigation contrary winds sea always fine winds obliged schooner tack often made little headway toward eastthe breeze feeble longed reach parts prevailing winds would favorable must stated endeavored initiate young novice mysteries entomology shown rather refractory advances want better company savant fallen back negroes comprehended nothing even finished deserting class professor found reduced alone seemed natural disposition distinguish parasite thysanuran gigantic black lived world coleopteras carnivorous insects hunters gunners ditchers cicindelles carabes sylphides moles cockchafers hornbeetles tenebrions mites ladybirds studying collection latter trembled seeing frail specimens great hands hard strong vise
4656,"But the colossal pupil listened so quietly to the professor's lessons that it was worth risking something to give them. While Cousin Benedict worked in that manner, Mrs. Weldon did not leave little Jack entirely unoccupied; She taught him to read and to write. As to arithmetic, it was his friend Dick Sand who inculcated the first elements. At the age of five, one is still only a little child, and is perhaps better instructed by practical games than by theoretical lessons necessarily a little arduous. Jack learned to read, not in a primer, but by means of movable letters, printed in red on cubes of wood. He amused himself by arranging the blocks so as to form words. Sometimes Mrs. Weldon took these cubes and composed a word; then she disarranged them, and it was for Jack to replace them in the order required. The little boy liked this manner of learning to read very much. Each day he passed some hours, sometimes in the cabin, sometimes on the deck, in arranging and disarranging the letters of his alphabet. Now, one day this led to an incident so extraordinary, so unexpected, that it is necessary to relate with some detail.",test,0,2,0,colossal pupil listened quietly professors lessons worth risking something give worked manner leave little entirely unoccupied taught read write arithmetic friend inculcated first elements age five one still little child perhaps better instructed practical games theoretical lessons necessarily little arduous learned read primer means movable letters printed red cubes wood amused arranging blocks form words took cubes composed word disarranged replace order required little boy liked manner learning read much day passed hours sometimes cabin sometimes deck arranging disarranging letters alphabet one day led incident extraordinary unexpected necessary relate detail
4657,"It was on the morning of February 9th, Jack, half-lying on the deck, was amusing himself forming a word which old Tom was to put together again, after the letters had been mixed. Tom, with his hand over his eyes so as not to cheat, as he agreed, would see nothing, and did see nothing of the work of the little boy. Of these different letters, about fifty in number, some were large, others small. Besides, some of these cubes carried a figure, which taught the child to form numbers as well as to form words. These cubes were arranged on the deck, and little Jack was taking sometimes one, sometimes another, to make a word--a truly great labor. Now, for same moments, Dingo was moving round the young child, when suddenly it stopped. Its eyes became fixed, its right paw was raised, its tail wagged convulsively. Then, suddenly throwing itself on one of the cubes, it seized it in its mouth and laid it on the deck a few steps from Jack. This cube bore a large letter--the letter S.  ""Dingo, well Dingo""! cried the little boy, who at first was afraid that his S was swallowed by the dog.",test,0,2,0,morning halflying deck amusing forming word old put together letters mixed hand eyes cheat agreed would see nothing see nothing work little boy different letters fifty number large others small cubes carried figure taught child form numbers well form words cubes arranged deck little taking sometimes one sometimes another make worda truly great labor moments moving round young child suddenly stopped eyes became fixed right paw raised tail wagged convulsively suddenly throwing one cubes seized mouth laid deck steps cube bore large letterthe letter well cried little boy first afraid swallowed dog
4658,"But Dingo had returned, and, beginning the same performance again, it seized another cube, and went to lay it near the first. This second cube was a large V.  This time Jack gave a cry. At this cry, Mrs. Weldon, Captain Hull, and the young novice, who were walking on the deck, assembled. Little Jack then told them what had just passed. Dingo knew its letters; Dingo knew how to read! That was very certain, that! Jack had seen it! Dick Sand wanted to go and take the two cubes, to restore them to his friend Jack, but Dingo showed him its teeth. However, the novice succeeded in gaining possession of the two cubes, and he replaced them in the set.

4659,"This time its two paws lay on them; it seemed decided to guard them at all hazards. As to the other letters of the alphabet, it did not seem as if it had any knowledge of them. ""That is a curious thing,"" said Mrs. Weldon. ""It is, in fact, very singular,"" replied Captain Hull, who was looking attentively at the two letters. ""S. V.,"" said Mrs. Weldon. ""S. V.,"" repeated Captain Hull. ""But those are precisely the letters which are on Dingo's collar""!

""And have you not added that the captain of the 'Waldeck' had picked up this dog on the western coast of Africa""? ""Yes, sir, in the neighborhood of the mouth of the Congo. I have often heard the captain say so"". ""So,"" asked Captain Hull, ""it has never been known to whom this dog had belonged, nor whence it came""? ""Never, sir. A dog found is worse than a child! That has no papers, and, more, it cannot explain"". Captain Hull was silent, and reflected.

4661,"Mrs. Weldon asked Captain Hull, after leaving him to his reflections for some moments. ""Yes, Mrs. Weldon, a remembrance, or rather a coincidence at least singular"". What""? ""Those two letters might well have a meaning, and fix for us the fate of an intrepid traveler"". ""What do you mean""? demanded Mrs. Weldon. ""Here is what I mean, Mrs. Weldon. In 1871--consequently two years ago--a French traveler set out, under the auspices of the Paris Geographical Society, with the intention of crossing Africa from the west to the east. His point of departure was precisely the mouth of the Congo. His point of arrival would be as near as possible to Cape Deldago, at the mouths of the Rovuma, whose course he would descend.",test,0,1,0,asked leaving reflections moments remembrance rather coincidence least singular two letters might well meaning fix us fate intrepid traveler mean demanded mean two years agoa traveler set auspices intention crossing west east point departure precisely mouth point arrival would near possible mouths whose course would descend
4662,"Now, this French traveler was named Samuel Vernon"". ""Samuel Vernon""! repeated Mrs. Weldon. ""Yes, Mrs. Weldon; and those two names begin precisely by those two letters which Dingo has chosen among all the others, and which are engraved on its collar"". ""Exactly,"" replied Mrs. Weldon. ""And that traveler----""  ""That traveler set out,"" replied Captain Hull, ""and has not been heard of since his departure"". ""Never""? said the novice. ""Never,"" repeated Captain Hull. ""What do you conclude from it""?",test,0,4,1,traveler named repeated two names begin precisely two letters chosen among others engraved collar replied traveler traveler set replied heard since departure said novice repeated conclude
4663,"asked Mrs. Weldon. ""That, evidently, Samuel Vernon has not been able to reach the eastern coast of Africa, whether he may have been made prisoner by the natives, whether death may have struck him on the way"". ""And then this dog""? ""This dog would have belonged to him; and, more fortunate than its master, if my hypothesis is true, it would have been able to return to the Congo coast, because it was there, at the time when these events must have taken place, that it was picked up by the captain of the 'Waldeck. '""  ""But,"" observed Mrs. Weldon, ""do you know if this French traveler was accompanied on his departure by a dog? Is it not a mere supposition on your part""? ""It is only a supposition, indeed, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied Captain Hull. ""But what is certain is, that Dingo knows these two letters S and V, which are precisely the initials of the two names of the French traveler. Now, under what circumstances this animal would learn to distinguish them is what I cannot explain; but, I repeat it, it very certainly knows them; and look, it pushes them with its paw, and seems to invite us to read them with it"".

4664,"""Then was Samuel Vernon alone when he left the sea-coast of the Congo""? ask Dick Sand. ""That I know not,"" replied Captain Hull. ""However, it is probable that he would take a native escort"". At that moment Negoro, leaving his post, showed himself on the deck. At first no one remarked his presence, and could not observe the singular look he cast on the dog when he perceived the two letters over which the animal seem to mount guard. But Dingo, having perceived the master-cook, began to show signs of the most extreme fury. Negoro returned immediately to the crew's quarters, not without a menacing gesture at the dog's skill having escaped him. ""There is some mystery there,"" murmured Captain Hull, who had lost none of this little scene.

4665,"""No""! cried little Jack. ""Mama has often told me the story of a dog which knew how to read and write, and even play dominoes, like a real schoolmaster""! ""My dear child,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, smiling, ""that dog, whose name was Munito, was not a savant, as you suppose. If I may believe what has been told me about it, Munito would not have been able to distinguish the letters which served to compose the words. But its master, a clever American, having remarked what fine hearing Munito had, applied himself to cultivating that sense, and to draw from it some very curious effects"". ""How did he set to work, Mrs. Weldon""? asked Dick Sand, whom the history interested almost as much as little Jack. ""In this way, my friend"".

4666,"On that table the poodle walked about, waiting till a word was proposed, whether in a loud voice or in a low voice. Only, one essential condition was that its master should know the word"". ""And, in the absence of its master--"" said the novice. ""The dog could have done nothing,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, ""and here is the reason. The letters spread out on the table, Munito walked about through this alphabet. When it arrived before the letter which it should choose to form the word required, it stopped; but if it stopped it was because it heard the noise--imperceptible to all others--of a toothpick that the American snapped in his pocket. That noise was the signal for Munito to take the letter and arrange it in suitable order"". ""And that was all the secret""? cried Dick Sand.

4667,"""It is very simple, like all that is done in the matter of prestidigitation. In case of the American's absence, Munito would be no longer Munito. I am, then, astonished, his master not being there--if, indeed, the traveler, Samuel Vernon, has ever been its master--that Dingo could have recognized those two letters"". ""In fact,"" replied Captain Hull, ""it is very astonishing. But, take notice, there are only two letters in question here, two particular letters, and not a word chosen by chance. After all, that dog which rang at the door of a convent to take possession of the plate intended for the poor passers-by, that other which commissioned at the same time with one of its kind, to turn the spit for two days each, and which refused to fill that office when its turn had not come, those two dogs, I say, advanced farther than Dingo into that domain of intelligence reserved for man. Besides, we are in the presence of an inscrutable fact. Of all the letters of that alphabet, Dingo has only chosen these two: S and V. The others it does not even seem to know. Therefore we must conclude that, for a reason which escapes us, its attention has been especially drawn to those two letters"".

4668,"Captain Hull,"" replied the young novice, ""if Dingo could speak! Perhaps he would tell us what those two letters signify, and why it has kept a tooth ready for our head cook"". ""And what a tooth""! replied Captain Hull, as Dingo, opening its mouth, showed its formidable fangs. *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER VI. A WHALE IN SIGHT. It will be remembered that this singular incident was made, more than once, the subject of conversation held in the stern of the ""Pilgrim"" between Mrs. Weldon, Captain Hull, and the young novice. The latter, more particularly, experienced an instinctive mistrust with regard to Negoro, whose conduct, meanwhile, merited no reproach. In the prow they talked of it also, but they did not draw from it the same conclusions. There, among the ship's crew, Dingo passed merely for a dog that knew how to read, and perhaps even write, better than more than one sailor on board.",test,0,1,0,replied young novice could speak would tell us two letters signify kept tooth ready head cook tooth replied opening mouth showed formidable fangs remembered singular incident made subject conversation held stern young novice latter particularly experienced instinctive mistrust regard whose conduct meanwhile merited reproach prow talked also draw conclusions among ships crew passed merely dog knew read perhaps even write better one sailor board
4669,"As for talking, if he did not do it, it was probably for good reasons that he kept silent. ""But, one of these fine days,"" says the steersman, Bolton, ""one fine day that dog will come and ask us how we are heading; if the wind is to the west-north-west-half-north, and we will have to answer him! There are animals that speak! Well, why should not a dog do as much if he took it into his head? It is more difficult to talk with a beak than with a mouth""! ""No doubt,"" replied the boatswain, Howik. ""Only it has never been known"". It would have astonished these brave men to tell them that, on the contrary, it had been known, and that a certain Danish servant possessed a dog which pronounced distinctly twenty words. But whether this animal comprehended what he said was a mystery. Very evidently this dog, whose glottis was organized in a manner to enable him to emit regular sounds, attached no more sense to his words than do the paroquets, parrots, jackdaws, and magpies to theirs.",test,0,2,0,talking probably good reasons kept silent one fine days says steersman fine day dog come ask us heading wind westnorthwesthalfnorth answer animals speak dog much took head difficult talk beak mouth doubt replied boatswain never known would astonished brave men tell contrary known certain servant possessed dog pronounced distinctly twenty words whether animal comprehended said mystery evidently dog whose glottis organized manner enable emit regular sounds attached sense words paroquets parrots jackdaws magpies
4670,"A phrase with animals is nothing more than a kind of song or spoken cry, borrowed from a strange language of which they do not know the meaning. However that might be, Dingo had become the hero of the deck, of which fact he took no proud advantage. Several times Captain Hull repeated the experiment. The wooden cubes of the alphabet were placed before Dingo, and invariably, without an error, without hesitation, the two letters, S and V, were chosen from among all by the singular animal, while the others never attracted his attention. As for Cousin Benedict, this experiment was often renewed before him, without seeming to interest him. ""Meanwhile,"" he condescended to say one day, ""we must not believe that the dogs alone have the privilege of being intelligent in this manner. Other animals equal them, simply in following their instinct. Look at the rats, who abandon the ship destined to founder at sea; the beavers, who know how to foresee the rising of the waters, and build their dams higher in consequence; those horses of Nicomedes, of Scanderberg, and of Oppien, whose grief was such that they died when their masters did; those asses, so remarkable for their memory, and many other beasts which have done honor to the animal kingdom. Have we not seen birds, marvelously erect, that correctly write words dictated by their professors; cockatoos that count, as well as a reckoner in the Longitude Office, the number of persons present in a parlor?

4671,"Finally, the legitimate pride of an entomologist should be raised to the highest point, when he sees simple insects give proofs of a superior intelligence, and affirm eloquently the axiom:       ""'In minimis maximus Deus,'  those ants which, represent the inspectors of public works in the largest cities, those aquatic _argyronetes_ which manufacture diving-bells, without having ever learned the mechanism; those fleas which draw carriages like veritable coachmen, which go through the exercise as well as riflemen, which fire off cannon better than the commissioned artillerymen of West Point? No! this Dingo does not merit so many eulogies, and if he is so strong on the alphabet, it is, without doubt, because he belongs to a species of mastiff, not yet classified in zoological science, the _canis alphabeticus_ of New Zealand"". In spite of these discourses and others of the envious entomologist, Dingo lost nothing in the public estimation, and continued to be treated as a phenomenon in the conversations of the forecastle. All this time, it is probable that Negoro did not share the enthusiasm of the ship in regard to the animal. Perhaps he found it too intelligent. However, the dog always showed the same animosity against the head cook, and, doubtless, would have brought upon itself some misfortune, if it had not been, for one thing, ""a dog to defend itself,"" and for another, protected by the sympathy of the whole crew. So Negoro avoided coming into Dingo's presence more than ever. But Dick Sand had observed that since the incident of the two letters, the reciprocal antipathy between the man and the dog was increased. That was truly inexplicable.",test,0,3,0,legitimate pride entomologist raised highest point sees simple insects give proofs superior intelligence affirm eloquently axiom minimis maximus ants represent inspectors public works largest cities aquatic manufacture divingbells without ever learned mechanism fleas draw carriages like veritable coachmen go exercise well riflemen fire cannon better commissioned artillerymen merit many eulogies strong alphabet without doubt belongs species mastiff yet classified zoological science alphabeticus spite discourses others envious entomologist lost nothing public estimation continued treated phenomenon conversations forecastle time probable share enthusiasm ship regard animal found intelligent dog always showed animosity head cook doubtless would brought upon misfortune one thing dog defend another protected sympathy whole crew avoided coming presence ever observed since incident two letters reciprocal antipathy man dog increased truly inexplicable
4672,"On February 10th, the wind from the northeast, which, till then, had always succeeded those long and overwhelming calms, during which the ""Pilgrim"" was stationary, began to abate perceptibly. Captain Hull then could hope that a change in the direction of the atmospheric currents was going to take place. Perhaps the schooner would finally sail with the wind. It was still only nineteen days since her departure from the port of Auckland. The delay was not yet of much account, and, with a favorable wind, the ""Pilgrim,"" well rigged, would easily make up for lost time. But several days must still elapse before the breezes would blow right from the west. This part of the Pacific was always deserted. No vessel showed itself in these parts. It was a latitude truly forsaken by navigators.

4673,"On the ""Pilgrim,"" which peculiar circumstances had obliged to leave the fishing grounds before the end of the season, they must not expect to cross any ship bound for the same destination. As to the trans-pacific packet-boats, it has been already said that they did not follow so high a parallel in their passages between Australia and the American continent. However, even if the sea is deserted, one must not give up observing it to the extreme limits of the horizon. Monotonous as it may appear to heedless minds, it is none the less infinitely varied for him who knows how to comprehend it. Its slightest changes charm the imagination of one who feels the poetry of the ocean. A marine herb which floats up and down on the waves, a branch of sargasso whose light track zebras, the surface of the waters, and end of a board, whose history he would wish to guess, he would need nothing more. Facing this infinite, the mind is no longer stopped by anything. Imagination runs riot. Each of those molecules of water, that evaporation is continually changing from the sea to the sky, contains perhaps the secret of some catastrophe. So, those are to be envied, whose inner consciousness knows how to interrogate the mysteries of the ocean, those spirits who rise from its moving surface to the heights of heaven.",test,0,2,0,peculiar circumstances obliged leave fishing grounds end season must expect cross ship bound destination transpacific packetboats already said follow high parallel passages continent even sea deserted one must give observing extreme limits horizon may appear heedless minds none less infinitely varied knows comprehend slightest changes charm imagination one feels poetry ocean marine herb floats waves branch sargasso whose light track zebras surface waters end board whose history would wish guess would need nothing infinite mind longer stopped anything runs riot molecules water evaporation continually changing sea sky contains perhaps secret catastrophe envied whose inner consciousness knows interrogate mysteries ocean spirits rise moving surface heights heaven
4674,"Besides, life always manifests itself above as well as below the seas. The ""Pilgrim's"" passengers could see flights of birds excited in the pursuit of the smallest fishes, birds which, before winter, fly from the cold climate of the poles. And more than once, Dick Sand, a scholar of Mrs. Weldon's in that branch as in others, gave proofs of marvelous skill with the gun and pistol, in bringing down some of those rapid-winged creatures. There were white petrels here; there, other petrels, whose wings were embroidered with brown. Sometimes, also, companies of _damiers_ passed, or some of those penquins whose gait on land is so heavy and so ridiculous. However, as Captain Hull remarked, these penquins, using their stumps like true fins, can challenge the most rapid fishes in swimming, to such an extent even, that sailors have often confounded them with bonitoes. Higher, gigantic albatrosses beat the air with great strokes, displaying an extent of ten feet between the extremities of their wings, and then came to light on the surface of the waters, which they searched with their beaks to get their food. All these scenes made a varied spectacle, that only souls closed to the charms of nature would have found monotonous. That day Mrs. Weldon was walking aft on the ""Pilgrim,"" when a rather curious phenomenon attracted her attention. The waters of the sea had become reddish quite suddenly.",test,0,3,0,life always manifests well seas passengers could see flights birds excited pursuit smallest fishes birds winter fly cold climate poles scholar branch others gave proofs marvelous skill gun pistol bringing rapidwinged creatures white petrels petrels whose wings embroidered brown also companies passed penquins whose gait land heavy ridiculous remarked penquins using stumps like true fins challenge rapid fishes swimming extent even sailors often confounded bonitoes gigantic albatrosses beat air great strokes displaying extent ten feet extremities wings came light surface waters searched beaks get food scenes made varied spectacle souls closed charms nature would found monotonous day walking aft rather curious phenomenon attracted attention waters sea become reddish quite suddenly

""Dick,"" she said to the young novice, ""Do you see that singular color of the waters of the Pacific? Is it due to the presence of a marine herb""? ""No, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied Dick Sand, ""that tinge is produced by myriads of little crustaceans, which generally serve to nourish the great mammifers.

""For instance----I find you passably disdainful for an entomologist""! ""Entomologist, it may be,"" replied Cousin Benedict, ""but more particularly hexapodist, Captain Hull, please remember"".

We are certain that the game is not distant"". ""Is it possible that such little beasts can feed such large ones""? cried Jack. ""Ah! my boy,"" replied Captain Hull, ""little grains of vermicelli, of flour, of fecula powder, do they not make very good porridge? Yes; and nature has willed that it should be so. When a whale floats in the midst of these red waters, its soup is served; it has only to open its immense mouth. Myriads of crustaceans enter it.

4679,"""You think right, Jack,"" observed Dick Sand, ""that Madam Whale does not lose time in picking these crustaceans one by one, as you pick shrimps"". ""I may add,"" said Captain Hull, ""that it is just when the enormous gourmand is occupied in this way, that it is easiest to approach it without exciting its suspicion. That is the favorable moment to harpoon it with some success"". At that instant, and as if to corroborate Captain Hull, a sailor's voice was heard from the front of the ship:  ""A whale to larboard""! Captain Hull strode up. ""A whale""! cried he. And his fisherman's instinct urging him, he hastened to the ""Pilgrim's"" forecastle. Mrs. Weldon, Jack, Dick Sand, Cousin Benedict himself, followed him at once.

4680,"Whalers could not be mistaken in it. But the distance was still too considerable to make it possible to recognize the species to which this mammifer belonged. These species, in fact, are quite distinct. Was it one of those ""right"" whales, which the fishermen of the Northern Ocean seek most particularly? Those cetaceans, which lack the dorsal fin, but whose skin covers a thick stratum of lard, may attain a length of eighty feet, though the average does not exceed sixty, and then a single one of those monsters furnishes as much as a hundred barrels of oil. Was it, on the contrary, a ""humpback,"" belonging to the species of baloenopters, a designation whose termination should at least gain it the entomologist's esteem? These possess dorsal fins, white in color, and as long as half the body, which resemble a pair of wings--something like a flying whale. Had they not in view, more likely, a ""finback"" mammifer, as well known by the name ""jubarte,"" which is provided with a dorsal fin, and whose length may equal that of the ""right"" whale? Captain Hull and his crew could not yet decide, but they regarded the animal with more desire than admiration.

4681,"The hunters of large game, they say, are more eager than the hunters of small game. Then, the larger the animal, the more it excites covetousness. Then, how should hunters of elephants and fishers of whalers feel? And then there was that disappointment, felt by all the ""Pilgrim's"" crew, of returning with an incomplete cargo. Meanwhile, Captain Hull tried to distinguish the animal which had been signaled in the offing. It was not very visible from that distance. Nevertheless, the trained eye of a whaler could not be deceived in certain details easier to discern at a distance. In fact, the water-spout, that is, that column of vapor and water which the whale throws back by its rents, would attract Captain Hull's attention, and fix it on the species to which this cetacean belonged. ""That is not a 'right' whale,"" cried he.

4682,"On the other hand, if the noise made by that spout in escaping could be compared to the distant noise of a cannon, I should be led to believe that that whale belongs to the species of 'humpbacks;' but there is nothing of the kind, and, on listening, we are assured that this noise is of quite a different nature. What is your opinion on this subject, Dick""? asked Captain Hull, turning toward the novice. ""I am ready to believe, captain,"" replied Dick Sand, ""that we have to do with a jubarte. See how his rents throw that column of liquid violently into the air. Does it not seem to you also--which would confirm my idea--that that spout contains more water than condensed vapor? And, if I am not mistaken, it is a special peculiarity of the jubarte"". ""In fact, Dick,"" replied Captain Hull, ""there is no longer any doubt possible!

""I would dare to affirm that it is a jubarte of great size,"" observed Dick Sand. ""Truly,"" replied Captain Hull, who was gradually becoming more excited. ""I think it is at least seventy feet long""! ""Good""! added the boatswain. ""Half a dozen whales of that size would suffice to fill a ship as large as ours""! ""Yes, that would be sufficient,"" replied Captain Hull, who mounted on the bowsprit to see better.

4684,"""Yes! --truly--yes""! murmured Captain Hull. ""That is true,"" continued Dick Sand; ""but it is sometimes a hard matter to attack those enormous jubartes""! ""Very hard, very hard""! returned Captain Hull. ""Those baloenopters have formidable tails, which must not be approached without distrust. The strongest pirogue would not resist a well-given blow.

4685,"said one of the sailors, ""a fine jubarte is all the same a fine capture""! ""And profitable""! replied another. ""It would be a pity not to salute this one on the way""! It was evident that these brave sailors were growing excited in looking at the whale. It was a whole cargo of barrels of oil that was floating within reach of their hands. To hear them, without doubt there was nothing more to be done, except to stow those barrels in the ""Pilgrim's"" hold to complete her lading. Some of the sailors, mounted on the ratlines of the fore-shrouds, uttered longing cries. Captain Hull, who no longer spoke, was in a dilemma.

4688,"Could fishermen let such an occasion escape them? However, Mrs. Weldon believed she ought to ask Captain Hull if it was not dangerous for his men and for him to attack a whale under those circumstances. ""No, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied Captain Hull. ""More than once it has been my lot to hunt the whale with a single boat, and I have always finished by taking possession of it. I repeat it, there is no danger for us, nor, consequently, for yourself"". Mrs. Weldon, reassured, did not persist. Captain Hull at once made his preparations for capturing the jubarte. He knew by experience that the pursuit of that baloenopter was not free from difficulties, and he wished to parry all. What rendered this capture less easy was that the schooner's crew could only work by means of a single boat, while the ""Pilgrim"" possessed a long-boat, placed on its stocks between the mainmast and the mizzen-mast, besides three whale-boats, of which two were suspended on the larboard and starboard pegs, and the third aft, outside the crown-work. Generally these three whale-boats were employed simultaneously in the pursuit of cetaceans.",test,0,2,0,fishermen let occasion escape believed ought ask dangerous men attack whale circumstances replied lot hunt whale single boat always finished taking possession repeat danger us consequently reassured persist made preparations capturing jubarte knew experience pursuit baloenopter free difficulties wished parry rendered capture less easy schooners crew could work means single boat possessed longboat placed stocks mainmast mizzenmast besides three whaleboats two suspended larboard starboard pegs third aft outside crownwork three whaleboats employed simultaneously pursuit cetaceans
4689,"But during the fishing season, we know, an additional crew, hired at the stations of New Zealand, came to the assistance of the ""Pilgrim's"" sailors. Now, in the present circumstances, the ""Pilgrim"" could only furnish the five sailors on board--that is, enough to arm a single whale-boat. To utilize the group of Tom and his friends, who had offered themselves at once, was impossible. In fact, the working of a fishing pirogue requires very well trained seamen. A false move of the helm, or a false stroke of an oar, would be enough to compromise the safety of the whale-boat during an attack. On the other hand, Captain Hull did not wish to leave his ship without leaving on board at least one man from the crew, in whom he had confidence. It was necessary to provide for all eventualities. Now Captain Hull, obliged to choose strong seamen to man the whale-boat, was forced to put on Dick Sand the care of guarding the ""Pilgrim"". ""Dick,"" said he to him, ""I shall charge you to remain on board during my absence, which I hope will be short"". ""Well, sir,"" replied the young novice.",test,0,2,0,fishing season know additional crew hired stations came assistance sailors present circumstances could furnish five sailors boardthat enough arm single whaleboat utilize group friends offered impossible fact working fishing pirogue requires well trained seamen false move helm false stroke oar would enough compromise safety whaleboat attack hand wish leave ship without leaving board least one man crew confidence necessary provide eventualities obliged choose strong seamen man whaleboat forced put care guarding said shall charge remain board absence hope short sir replied young novice
4690,"Dick Sand would have wished to take part in this fishing, which had a great attraction for him, but he understood that, for one reason, a man's arms were worth more than his for service in a whale-boat, and that for another, he alone could replace Captain Hull. So he was satisfied. The whale-boat's crew must be composed of the five men, including the master, Howik, which formed the whole crew of the ""Pilgrim"". The four sailors were going to take their places at the oars, and Howik would hold the stern oar, which serves to guide a boat of this kind. A simple rudder, in fact, would not have a prompt enough action, and in case the side oars should be disabled, the stern oar, well handled, could put the whale-boat beyond the reach of the monster's blows. There was only Captain Hull besides. He had reserved to himself the post of harpooner, and, as he had said, this would not be his first attempt. It was he who must first throw the harpoon, then watch the unrolling of the long line fastened at its end; then, finally finish the animal with spears, when it should return to the surface of the ocean. Whalers sometimes employ firearms for this kind of fishing. By means of a special instrument, a sort of small cannon, stationed either on board the ship or at the front of the boat, they throw either a harpoon, which draws with it the rope fastened to its end, or explosive balls, which produce great ravages in the body of the animal.",test,0,3,0,would wished take part fishing great attraction understood one reason mans arms worth service whaleboat another alone could replace satisfied whaleboats crew must composed five men including master formed whole crew four sailors going take places oars would hold stern oar serves guide boat kind simple rudder fact would prompt enough action case side oars disabled stern oar well handled could put whaleboat beyond reach monsters blows besides reserved post harpooner said would first attempt must first throw harpoon watch unrolling long line fastened end finally finish animal spears return surface ocean sometimes employ firearms kind fishing means special instrument sort small cannon stationed either board ship front boat throw either harpoon draws rope fastened end explosive balls produce great ravages body animal
4691,"But the ""Pilgrim"" was not furnished with apparatus of this kind. This was, besides, an instrument of high price, rather difficult to manage, and fishermen, but little friendly to innovations, seem to prefer the employment of primitive weapons, which they use skilfully--that is to say,--the harpoon and spear. It was then by the usual method, attacking the whale with the sword, that Captain Hull was going to attempt to capture the jubarte signaled five miles from his ship. Besides, the weather would favor this expedition. The sea, being very calm, was propitious for the working of a whale-boat. The wind was going down, and the ""Pilgrim"" would only drift in an insensible manner while her crew were occupied in the offing. So the starboard whale-boat was immediately lowered, and the four sailors went into it. Howik passed them two of those long spears which serve as harpoons, then two long lances with sharp points. To those offensive arms he added five coils of those strong flexible ropes that the whalers call ""lines,"" and which measure six hundred feet in length. Less would not do, for it sometimes happens that these cords, fastened end to end, are not enough for the ""demand,"" the whale plunges down so deep.",test,0,2,0,furnished apparatus kind besides instrument high price rather difficult manage fishermen little friendly innovations seem prefer employment primitive weapons use skilfullythat saythe harpoon spear usual method attacking whale sword going attempt capture jubarte signaled five miles ship weather would favor expedition sea calm propitious working whaleboat wind going would drift insensible manner crew occupied offing starboard whaleboat immediately lowered four sailors went passed two long spears serve harpoons two long lances sharp points offensive arms added five coils strong flexible ropes whalers call measure six hundred feet length would sometimes happens cords fastened end end enough whale plunges deep
4692,"Such were the different weapons which were carefully disposed in the front of the boat. Howik and the four sailors only waited for the order to let go the rope. A single place was vacant in the prow of the whale-boat--that which Captain Hull would occupy. It is needless to say that the ""Pilgrim's"" crew, before quitting her, had brought the ship's sails aback. In other words, the yards were braced in such a manner that the sails, counteracting their action, kept the vessel almost stationary. Just as he was about to embark, Captain Hull gave a last glance at his ship. He was sure that all was in order, the halliards well turned, the sails suitably trimmed. As he was leaving the young novice on board during an absence which might last several hours, he wished, with a good reason, that unless for some urgent cause, Dick Sand would not have to execute a single maneuver. At the moment of departing he gave the young man some last words of advice.

There is no indication that it will freshen again. Above all, whatever may happen, do not put a boat to sea, and do not leave the ship"". ""That is understood"". ""If it should become necessary for the 'Pilgrim' to come to us, I shall make a signal to you, by hoisting a flag at the end of a boat-hook"".

Captain Hull understood that blush and that smile. ""The honest boy""! he said to himself; ""modesty and good humor, in truth, it is just like him""! Meanwhile, by these urgent recommendations, it was plain that, even though there would be no danger in doing it, Captain Hull did not leave his ship willingly, even for a few hours.

4696,"Besides, that sea, so fine, was marvelously conducive to the pursuit of a cetacean. Neither his crew nor he could resist such a temptation. The fishing cruise would be finally complete, and this last consideration touched Captain Hull's heart above everything. Captain Hull went toward the ladder. ""I wish you success,"" said Mrs. Weldon to him. ""Thank you, Mrs. Weldon"". ""I beg you, do not do too much harm to the poor whale,"" cried little Jack. ""No, my boy,"" replied Captain Hull.

During our absence they will bring them on deck, and by this means the work will go fast on our return"". ""That shall be done, captain"".

4698,"Then the sailors, shod in boots, with cramp-hooks would take their places on the back of the enormous cetacean, and cut it up methodically in parallel bands marked off from the head to the tail. These bands would be then cut across in slices of a foot and a half, then divided into pieces, which, after being stowed in the barrels, would be sent to the bottom of the hold. Generally the whaling ship, when the fishing is over, manages to land as soon as possible, so as to finish her manipulations. The crew lands, and then proceeds to melt the lard, which, under the action of the heat, gives up all its useful part--that is, the oil. In this operation, the whale's lard weighs about a third of its weight. But, under present circumstances, Captain Hull could not dream of putting back to finish that operation. He only counted on melting this quantity of lard at Valparaiso. Besides, with winds which could not fail to hail from the west, he hoped to make the American coast before twenty days, and that lapse of time could not compromise the results of his fishing. The moment for setting out had come.

4699,"The jubarte was all this time swimming in the middle of the vast red field of crustaceans, opening its large mouth automatically, and absorbing at each draught myriads of animalcules. According to the experienced ones on board, there was no fear that the whale dreamt of escaping. It was, doubtless, what the whalers call a ""fighting"" whale. Captain Hull strode over the netting, and, descending the rope ladder, he reached the prow of the whale-boat. Mrs. Weldon, Jack, Cousin Benedict, Tom, and his companions, for a last time wished the captain success. Dingo itself, rising on its paws and passing its head above the railing, seemed to wish to say good-by to the crew. Then all returned to the prow, so as to lose none of the very attractive movements of such a fishing. The whale-boat put off, and, under the impetus of its four oars, vigorously handled, it began to distance itself from the ""Pilgrim"".

""That shall be done, captain,"" replied Dick Sand, who went to take his place near the helm. Already the light boat was several hundred feet from the ship. Captain Hull, standing at the prow, no longer able to make himself heard, renewed his injunctions by the most expressive gestures. It was then that Dingo, its paws still resting on the railing, gave a sort of lamentable bark, which would have an unfavorable effect upon men somewhat given to superstition.

4701,"But the dog barked no more, and, letting itself fall back on its paws, it came slowly to Mrs. Weldon, whose hand it licked affectionately. ""It does not wag its tail,"" murmured Tom in a low tone. ""Bad sign--bad sign"". But almost at once Dingo stood up, and a howl of anger escaped it. Mrs. Weldon turned round. Negoro had just left his quarters, and was going toward the forecastle, with the intention, no doubt, of looking for himself at the movements of the whale-boat. Dingo rushed at the head cook, a prey to the strongest as well as to the most inexplicable fury. Negoro seized a hand-spike and took an attitude of defense. The dog was going to spring at his throat.

Dingo obeyed, not without repugnance, and returned to the young novice, growling secretly. Negoro had not pronounced a single word, but his face had grown pale for a moment. Letting go of his hand-spike, he regained his cabin. ""Hercules,"" then said Dick Sand, ""I charge you especially to watch over that man"". ""I shall watch,"" simply replied Hercules, clenching his two enormous fists in sign of assent. Mrs. Weldon and Dick Sand then turned their eyes again on the whale-boat, which the four oarsmen bore rapidly away.

4703,"THE JUBARTE. Captain Hull, an experienced whaler, would leave nothing to chance. The capture of a jubarte is a difficult thing. No precaution ought to be neglected. None was in this case. And, first of all, Captain Hull sailed so as to come up to the whale on the leeward, so that no noise might disclose the boat's approach. Howik then steered the whale-boat, following the rather elongated curve of that reddish shoal, in the midst of which floated the jubarte. They would thus turn the curve.

""That is understood, sir,"" replied the boatswain. ""I am going to follow the contour of these reddish waters, so as to keep to the leeward"". ""Good""! said Captain Hull.

4705,"The starboard oars still sank in the green and limpid water, while those to larboard, raising the reddish liquid, seemed to rain drops of blood. ""Wine and water""! said one of the sailors. ""Yes,"" replied Captain Hull, ""but water that we cannot drink, and wine that we cannot swallow. Come, boys, let us not speak any more, and heave closer""! The whale-boat, steered by the boatswain, glided noiselessly on the surface of those half-greased waters, as if it were floating on a bed of oil. The jubarte did not budge, and did not seem to have yet perceived the boat, which described a circle around it. Captain Hull, in making the circuit, necessarily went farther than the ""Pilgrim,"" which gradually grew smaller in the distance. This rapidity with which objects diminish at sea has always an odd effect.

4706,"This optical illusion evidently takes place because there are no points of comparison on these large spaces. It was thus with the ""Pilgrim,"" which decreased to the eye and seemed already much more distant than she really was. Half an hour after leaving her, Captain Hull and his companions found themselves exactly to the leeward of the whale, so that the latter occupied an intermediate point between the ship and the boat. So the moment had come to approach, while making as little noise as possible. It was not impossible for them to get beside the animal and harpoon it at good range, before its attention would be attracted. ""Row more slowly, boys,"" said Captain Hull, in a low voice. ""It seems to me,"" replied Howik, ""that the gudgeon suspects something. It breathes less violently than it did just now""!

4707,"repeated Captain Hull. Five minutes later the whale-boat was at a cable's length from the jubarte. A cable's length, a measure peculiar to the sea, comprises a length of one hundred and twenty fathoms, that is to say, two hundred meters. The boatswain, standing aft, steered in such a manner as to approach the left side of the mammal, but avoiding, with the greatest care, passing within reach of the formidable tail, a single blow of which would be enough to crush the boat. At the prow Captain Hull, his legs a little apart to maintain his equilibrium, held the weapon with which he was going to give the first blow. They could count on his skill to fix that harpoon in the thick mass which emerged from the waters. Near the captain, in a pail, was coiled the first of the five lines, firmly fastened to the harpoon, and to which they would successively join the other four if the whale plunged to great depths.

4708,"""Alongside! alongside""! The boatswain obeyed the order, and the whale-boat came within less than ten feet of the animal. The latter no longer moved, and seemed asleep. Whales thus surprised while asleep offer an easier prize, and it often happens that the first blow which is given wounds them mortally. ""This immovableness is quite astonishing""! thought Captain Hull. ""The rascal ought not to be asleep, and nevertheless----there is something there""!

4709,"Captain Hull, holding his harpoon by the middle of the handle, balanced it several times, to make sure of good aim, while he examined the jubarte's side. Then he threw it with all the strength of his arm. ""Back, back""! cried he at once. And the sailors, pulling together, made the boat recoil rapidly, with the intention of prudently putting it in safety from the blows of the cetacean's tail. But at that moment a cry from the boatswain made them understand why the whale was so extraordinarily motionless for so long a time on the surface of the sea. ""A young whale""! said he. In fact, the jubarte, after having been struck by the harpoon, was almost entirely overturned on the side, thus discovering a young whale, which she was in process of suckling. This circumstance, as Captain Hull well knew, would render the capture of the jubarte much more difficult.",test,0,2,0,holding harpoon middle handle balanced several times make sure good aim examined jubartes side threw strength arm back cried sailors pulling together made boat recoil rapidly intention prudently putting safety blows cetaceans tail moment cry boatswain made understand whale extraordinarily motionless long time surface sea young whale said fact jubarte struck harpoon almost entirely overturned side thus discovering young whale process suckling circumstance well knew would render capture jubarte much difficult
4710,"The mother was evidently going to defend herself with greater fury, as much for herself as to protect her ""little one ""--if, indeed, we can apply that epithet to an animal which did not measure less than twenty feet. Meanwhile, the jubarte did not rush at the boat, as there was reason to fear, and there was no necessity, before taking flight, to quickly cut the line which connected the boat with the harpoon. On the contrary, and as generally happens, the whale, followed by the young one, dived, at first in a very oblique line; then rising again with an immense bound, she commenced to cleave the waters with extreme rapidity. But before she had made her first plunge, Captain Hull and the boatswain, both standing, had had time to see her, and consequently to estimate her at her true value. This jubarte was, in reality, a whale of the largest size. From the head to the tail, she measured at least eighty feet. Her skin, of a yellowish brown, was much varied with numerous spots of a darker brown. It would indeed be a pity, after an attack so happily begun, to be under the necessity of abandoning so rich a prey. The pursuit, or rather the towing, had commenced.

4711,"Howik kept it steady, notwithstanding those rapid and frightful oscillations. Captain Hull, his eye on his prey, did not cease making his eternal refrain:  ""Be watchful, Howik, be watchful""! And they could be sure that the boatswain's vigilance would not be at fault for an instant. Meanwhile, as the whale-boat did not fly nearly as fast as the whale, the line of the harpoon spun out with such rapidity that it was to be feared that it would take fire in rubbing against the edge of the whale-boat. So Captain Hull took care to keep it damp, by filling with water the pail at the bottom of which the line was coiled. All this time the jubarte did not seem inclined to stop her flight, nor willing to moderate it. The second line was then lashed to the end of the first, and it was not long before it was played out with the same velocity. At the end of five minutes it was necessary to join on the third line, which ran off under the water. The jubarte did not stop.

4712,"They could even observe, by the increased obliquity of the line, that the animal, instead of returning to the surface, was sinking into lower depths. ""The devil""! cried Captain Hull, ""but that rascal will use up our five lines""! ""And lead us to a good distance from the 'Pilgrim,'"" replied the boatswain. ""Nevertheless, she must return to the surface to breathe,"" replied Captain Hull. ""She is not a fish, and she must have the provision of air like a common individual"". ""She has held her breath to run better,"" said one of the sailors, laughing. In fact, the line was unrolling all the time with equal rapidity. To the third line, it was soon necessary to join the fourth, and that was not done without making the sailors somewhat anxious touching their future part of the prize.

The jubarte is getting tired"".",test,0,4,1,devil murmured never seen anything like jubarte fifth line let already half unrolled seemed slacken good cried line less stiff jubarte getting tired
4714,"At that moment, the ""Pilgrim"" was more than five miles to the leeward of the whale-boat. Captain Hull, hoisting a flag at the end of a boat-hook, gave the signal to come nearer. And almost at once, he could see that Dick Sand, aided by Tom and his companions, commenced to brace the yards in such a manner as to trim them close to the wind. But the breeze was feeble and irregular. It only came in short puffs. Most certainly, the ""Pilgrim"" would have some trouble in joining the whale-boat, if indeed she could reach it. Meanwhile, as they had foreseen, the jubarte had returned to the surface of the water to breathe, with the harpoon fixed in her side all the time. She then remained almost motionless, seeming to wait for her young whale, which this furious course must have left behind. Captain Hull made use of the oars so as to join her again, and soon he was only a short distance from her. Two oars were laid down and two sailors armed themselves, as the captain had done, with long lances, intended to strike the enemy.",test,0,2,0,moment five miles leeward whaleboat hoisting flag end boathook gave signal come nearer almost could see aided companions commenced brace yards manner trim close wind breeze feeble irregular came short puffs certainly would trouble joining whaleboat indeed could reach foreseen jubarte returned surface water breathe harpoon fixed side time remained almost motionless seeming wait young whale furious course must left behind made use oars join soon short distance oars laid two sailors armed captain done long lances intended strike enemy
4715,"Howik worked skilfully then, and held himself ready to make the boat turn rapidly, in case the whale should turn suddenly on it. ""Attention""! cried Captain Hull. ""Do not lose a blow! Aim well, boys! Are we ready, Howik""? ""I am prepared, sir,"" replied the boatswain, ""but one thing troubles me. It is that the beast, after having fled so rapidly, is very quiet now"".

4716,"""Yes, but let us go forward"". Captain Hull grew more and more animated. The boat drew still nearer. The jubarte only turned in her place. Her young one was no longer near her; perhaps she was trying to find it again. Suddenly she made a movement with her tail, which took her thirty feet away. Was she then going to take flight again, and must they take up this interminable pursuit again on the surface of the waters? ""Attention""! cried Captain Hull. ""The beast is going to take a spring and throw herself on us.",test,0,4,2,let us go forward grew animated boat drew still nearer jubarte turned place young one longer near perhaps trying find made movement tail took thirty feet away going take flight must take interminable pursuit surface waters cried beast going take spring throw us
4717,"Steer, Howik, steer""! The jubarte, in fact, had turned in such a manner as to present herself in front of the whale-boat. Then, beating the sea violently with her enormous fins, she rushed forward. The boatswain, who expected this direct blow, turned in such a fashion that the jubarte passed by the boat, but without reaching it. Captain Hull and the two sailors gave her three vigorous thrusts on the passage, seeking to strike some vital organ. The jubarte stopped, and, throwing to a great height two columns of water mingled with blood, she turned anew on the boat, bounding, so to say, in a manner frightful to witness. These seamen must have been expert fishermen, not to lose their presence of mind on this occasion. Howik again skilfully avoided the jubarte's attack, by darting the boat aside. Three new blows, well aimed, again gave the animal three new wounds. But, in passing, she struck the water so roughly with her formidable tail, that an enormous wave arose, as if the sea were suddenly opened.",test,0,2,0,steer jubarte fact turned manner present front whaleboat beating sea violently enormous fins rushed forward boatswain expected direct blow turned fashion jubarte passed boat without reaching two sailors gave three vigorous thrusts passage seeking strike vital organ jubarte stopped throwing great height two columns water mingled blood turned anew boat bounding say manner frightful witness seamen must expert fishermen lose presence mind occasion skilfully avoided jubartes attack darting boat aside new blows well aimed gave animal three new wounds passing struck water roughly formidable tail enormous wave arose sea suddenly opened
4718,"The whale-boat almost capsized, and, the water rushing in over the side, it was half filled. ""The bucket, the bucket""! cried Captain Hull. The two sailors, letting go their oars, began to bale out the boat rapidly, while the captain cut the line, now become useless. No! the animal, rendered furious by grief, no longer dreamt of flight. It was her turn to attack, and her agony threatened to be terrible. A third time she turned round, ""head to head,"" a seaman would say, and threw herself anew on the boat.

4719,"If it could be no longer steered, there was still less power to escape. And besides, no matter how quickly the boat might be propelled, the swift jubarte would have always overtaken it with a few bounds. It was no longer a question of attack, but of defense. Captain Hull understood it all. The third attack of the animal could not be entirely kept off. In passing she grazed the whale-boat with her enormous dorsal fin, but with so much force that Howik was thrown down from his bench. The three lances, unfortunately affected by the oscillation, this time missed their aim. ""Howik!

4720,"""Present""! replied the boatswain, as he got up. But he then perceived that in his fall his stern oar had broken in the middle. ""Another oar""! said Captain Hull. ""I have one,"" replied Howik. At that moment, a bubbling took place under the waters only a few fathoms from the boat. The young whale had just reappeared. The jubarte saw it, and rushed towards it.

4721,"The whale was going to fight for two. Captain Hull looked toward the ""Pilgrim"". His hand shook the boat-hook, which bore the flag, frantically. What could Dick Sand do that had not been already done at the first signal from the captain? The ""Pilgrim's"" sails were trimmed, and the wind commenced to fill them. Unhappily the schooner did not possess a helix, by which the action could be increased to sail faster. To lower one of the boats, and, with the aid of the blacks, row to the assistance of the captain, would be a considerable loss of time; besides, the novice had orders not to quit the ship, no matter what happened. However, he had the stern-boat lowered from its pegs, and towed it along, so that the captain and his companions might take refuge in it, in case of need. At that moment the jubarte, covering the young whale with her body, had returned to the charge.

4722,"""Attention, Howik""! cried Captain Hull, for the last time. But the boatswain was, so to speak, disarmed. Instead of a lever, whose length gave force, he only held in his hand an oar relatively short. He tried to put about; it was impossible. The sailors knew that they were lost. All rose, giving a terrible cry, which was perhaps heard on the ""Pilgrim"". A terrible blow from the monster's tail had just struck the whale-boat underneath. The boat, thrown into the air with irresistible violence, fell back, broken in three pieces, in the midst of waves furiously lashed by the whale's bounds. The unfortunate sailors, although grievously wounded, would have had, perhaps, the strength to keep up still, either by swimming or by hanging on to some of the floating wreck.",test,0,1,0,cried last time boatswain speak disarmed lever whose length gave force held hand oar relatively short tried put impossible sailors knew lost rose giving terrible cry perhaps heard terrible blow monsters tail struck whaleboat underneath boat thrown air irresistible violence fell back broken three pieces midst waves furiously lashed whales bounds unfortunate sailors although grievously wounded would perhaps strength keep still either swimming hanging floating wreck
4723,"That is what Captain Hull did, for he was seen for a moment hoisting the boatswain on a wreck. But the jubarte, in the last degree of fury, turned round, sprang up, perhaps in the last pangs of a terrible agony, and with her tail she beat the troubled waters frightfully, where the unfortunate sailors were still swimming. For some minutes one saw nothing but a liquid water-spout scattering itself in sheafs on all sides. A quarter of an hour after, when Dick Sand, who, followed by the blacks, had rushed into the boat, had reached the scene of the catastrophe, every living creature had disappeared. There was nothing left but some pieces of the whale-boat on the surface of the waters, red with blood. *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER IX. CAPTAIN SAND. The first impression felt by the passengers of the ""Pilgrim"" in presence of this terrible catastrophe was a combination of pity and horror.

Captain Hull and his men had forever disappeared. When the schooner arrived at the fatal place, Mrs. Weldon fell on her knees, her hands raised toward Heaven. ""Let us pray""! said the pious woman. She was joined by her little Jack, who threw himself on his knees, weeping, near his mother. The poor child understood it all. Dick Sand, Nan, Tom, and the other blacks remained standing, their heads bowed. All repeated the prayer that Mrs. Weldon addressed to God, recommending to His infinite goodness those who had just appeared before Him.

4725,"Yes! They could not too earnestly implore the aid of Him who can do all things, for their situation was one of the gravest! This ship which carried them had no longer a captain to command her, no longer a crew to work her. She was in the middle of that immense Pacific Ocean, hundreds of miles from any land, at the mercy of the winds and waves. What fatality then had brought that whale in the ""Pilgrim's"" course? What still greater fatality had urged the unfortunate Captain Hull, generally so wise, to risk everything in order to complete his cargo? And what a catastrophe to count among the rarest of the annals of whale-fishing was this one, which did not allow of the saving of one of the whale-boat's sailors! Yes, it was a terrible fatality!

4726,"Captain, boatswain, sailors, it may be said that the whole crew was now concentrated in him. On board there was one lady passenger, a mother and her son, whose presence would render the situation much more difficult. Then there were also some blacks, honest men, courageous and zealous without a doubt, ready to obey whoever should undertake to command them, but ignorant of the simplest notions of the sailor's craft. Dick Sand stood motionless, his arms crossed, looking at the place where Captain Hull had just been swallowed up--Captain Hull, his protector, for whom he felt a filial affection. Then his eyes searched the horizon, seeking to discover some ship, from which he would demand aid and assistance, to which he might be able at least to confide Mrs. Weldon. He would not abandon the ""Pilgrim,"" no, indeed, without having tried his best to bring her into port. But Mrs. Weldon and her little boy would be in safety. He would have had nothing more to fear for those two beings, to whom he was devoted body and soul. The ocean was deserted.

4727,"All was sky and water around the ""Pilgrim"". The young novice knew only too well that he was beyond the routes followed by the ships of commerce, and that the other whalers were cruising still farther away at the fishing-grounds. However, the question was, to look the situation in the face, to see things as they were. That is what Dick Sand did, asking God, from the depths of his heart, for aid and succor. What resolution was he going to take? At that moment Negoro appeared on the deck, which he had left after the catastrophe. What had been felt in the presence of this irreparable misfortune by a being so enigmatical, no one could tell. He had contemplated the disaster without making a gesture, without departing from his speechlessness. His eye had evidently seized all the details of it.

4728,"At any rate, and as if he had not heard it, he had not responded to the pious appeal of Mrs. Weldon, praying for the engulfed crew. Negoro walked aft, there even where Dick Sand was standing motionless. He stopped three steps from the novice. ""You wish to speak to me""? asked Dick Sand.

4730,"We see, Dick's resolution was taken. Meanwhile the schooner, under the action of the breeze, which commenced to freshen, had already passed beyond the vast shoal of crustaceans. Dick Sand examined the condition of the sails; then his eyes were cast on the deck. He had then this sentiment, that, if a frightful responsibility fell upon him in the future, it was for him to have the strength to accept it. He dared to look at the survivors of the ""Pilgrim,"" whose eyes were now fixed on him. And, reading in their faces that he could count on them, he said to them in two words, that they could in their turn count on him. Dick Sand had, in all sincerity, examined his conscience. If he was capable of taking in or setting the sails of the schooner, according to circumstances, by employing the arms of Tom and his companions, he evidently did not yet possess all the knowledge necessary to determine his position by calculation. In four or five years more, Dick Sand would know thoroughly that beautiful and difficult sailor's craft.

4731,"He would read on the chronometer the hour of the meridian of Greenwich, and from it would be able to deduce the longitude by the hour angle. The sun would be made his counselor each day. The moon--the planets would say to him, ""There, on that point of the ocean, is thy ship""! That firmament, on which the stars move like the hands of a perfect clock, which nothing shakes nor can derange, and whose accuracy is absolute--that firmament would tell him the hours and the distances. By astronomical observations he would know, as his captain had known every day, nearly to a mile, the place occupied by the ""Pilgrim,"" and the course followed as well as the course to follow. And now, by reckoning, that is by the progress measured on the log, pointed out by the compass, and corrected by the drift, he must alone ask his way. However, he did not falter.

""Yes, I shall be able to put her prow to the east, nearly at the point of the American coast that we must reach"". ""But, Dick,"" returned Mrs. Weldon, ""you well understand, do you not, that this catastrophe may, and indeed must, modify our first projects?

We shall drive in the offing with all our sails set, from the brigantine to the flying-jib""! Dick Sand had spoken with the confidence of the seaman, who feels that he stands on a good ship, a ship of whose every movement he is master. He was going to take the helm and call his companions to set the sails properly, when Mrs. Weldon reminded him that he ought first to know the ""Pilgrim's"" position. It was, indeed, the first thing to do. Dick Sand went into the captain's cabin for the chart on which the position of the day before was indicated. He could then show Mrs. Weldon that the schooner was in latitude 43° 35', and in longitude 164° 13', for, in the last twenty-four hours, she had not, so to say, made any progress.",test,0,2,0,standing land renounce hope encountering vessels coasting trade shore wind begins blow steadily northwest grant may keep shall make progress good progress shall drive offing sails set brigantine flyingjib spoken confidence seaman feels stands good ship ship whose every movement master going take helm call companions set sails properly reminded ought first know position indeed first thing went captains cabin chart position day indicated could show schooner latitude longitude last twentyfour hours say made progress
4736,"Mrs. Weldon leaned over this chart. She looked at the brown color which represented the land on the right of the ocean. It was the coast of South America, an immense barrier thrown between the Pacific and the Atlantic from Cape Horn to the shores of Columbia. To consider it in that way, that chart, which, was then spread out under her eyes, on which was drawn a whole ocean, gave the impression that it would be easy to restore the ""Pilgrim's"" passengers to their country. It is an illusion which is invariably produced on one who is not familiar with the scale on which marine charts are drawn. And, in fact, it seemed to Mrs. Weldon that the land ought to be in sight, as it was on that piece of paper! And, meanwhile, on that white page, the ""Pilgrim"" drawn on an exact scale, would be smaller than the most microscopic of infusoria! That mathematical point, without appreciable dimensions, would appear lost, as it was in reality in the immensity of the Pacific!

4737,"But he had taken his part; he had become a man under the responsibility which had fallen upon him. The moment to act had come. He must profit by this northwest breeze which was blowing up. Contrary winds had given place to favorable winds, and some clouds scattered in the zenith under the cirrous form, indicated that they would blow steadily for at least a certain time. Dick called Tom and his companions. ""My friends,"" he said to them, ""our ship has no longer any crew but you. I cannot work without your aid. You are not sailors, but you have good arms.

""Well spoken, old Tom,"" said Mrs. Weldon. ""Yes, well spoken,"" continued Dick Sand; ""but we must be prudent, and I shall not carry too much canvas, so as not to run any risk. Circumstances require a little less speed, but more security. I will show you, my friends, what each will have to do in the work. As to me, I shall remain at the helm, as long as fatigue does not oblige me to leave it. From time to time a few hours' sleep will be sufficient to restore me.

""Whenever you like, Mr. Dick,"" replied the old black. ""Well,"" replied the novice, ""stay near me at the helm till the end of the day, and if fatigue overcomes me, you will then be able to replace me for a few hours"". ""And I,"" said little Jack, ""will I not be able to help my friend, Dick, a little""? ""Yes, dear child,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, clasping Jack in her arms, ""you shall learn to steer, and I am sure that while you are at the helm we shall have good winds"". ""Very sure--very sure.

4740,"Then, addressing Tom, and the other blacks: ""My friends,"" he said to them, ""we are going to put the 'Pilgrim' under full sail. You will only have to do what I shall tell you"". ""At your orders,"" replied Tom, ""at your orders, Captain Sand"". *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER X.  THE FOUR DAYS WHICH FOLLOW. Dick Sand was then captain of the ""Pilgrim,"" and, without losing an instant, he took the necessary measures for putting the ship under full sail. It was well understood that the passengers could have only one hope--that of reaching some part of the American coast, if not Valparaiso. What Dick Sand counted on doing was to ascertain the direction and speed of the ""Pilgrim,"" so as to get an average. For that, it was sufficient to make each day on the chart the way made, as it has been said, by the log and the compass. There was then on board one of those ""patent logs,"" with an index and helix, which give the speed very exactly for a fixed time. This useful instrument, very easily handled, could render the most useful services, and the blacks were perfectly adapted to work it.",test,0,2,0,addressing blacks friends said going put full sail shall tell orders replied orders captain without losing instant took necessary measures putting ship full sail well understood passengers could one hopethat reaching part coast counted ascertain direction speed get average sufficient make day chart way made said log compass board one logs index helix give speed exactly fixed time useful instrument easily handled could render useful services blacks perfectly adapted work
4741,"A single cause of error would interfere--the currents. To combat it, reckoning would be insufficient; astronomical observations alone would enable one to render an exact calculation from it. Now, those observations the young novice was still unable to make. For an instant Dick Sand had thought of bringing the ""Pilgrim"" back to New Zealand. The passage would be shorter, and he would certainly have done it if the wind, which, till then, had been contrary, had not become favorable. Better worth while then to steer for America. In fact, the wind had changed almost to the contrary direction, and now it blew from the northwest with a tendency to freshen. It was then necessary to profit by it and make all the headway possible. So Dick Sand prepared to put the ""Pilgrim"" under full sail. In a schooner brig-rigged, the foremast carries four square sails; the foresail, on the lower mast; above, the top-sail, on the topmast; then, on the top-gallant mast, a top-sail and a royal.",test,0,2,0,single cause error would interferethe currents combat reckoning would insufficient astronomical observations alone would enable one render exact calculation observations young novice still unable make instant thought bringing back passage would shorter would certainly done wind till contrary become favorable worth steer fact wind changed almost contrary direction blew northwest tendency freshen necessary profit make headway possible prepared put full sail schooner brigrigged foremast carries four square sails foresail lower mast topsail topmast topgallant mast topsail royal
4742,"The mainmast, on the contrary, has fewer sails. It only carries a brigantine below, and a fore-staffsail above. Between these two masts, on the stays which support them at the prow, a triple row of triangular sails may be set. Finally, at the prow, on the bowsprit, and its extreme end, were hauled the three jibs. The jibs, the brigantine, the fore-staff, and the stay-sails are easily managed. They can be hoisted from the deck without the necessity of climbing the masts, because they are not fastened on the yards by means of rope-bands, which must be previously loosened. On the contrary, the working of the foremast sails demands much greater proficiency in seamanship. In fact, when it is necessary to set them, the sailors must climb by the rigging--it may be in the foretop, it may be on the spars of the top-gallant mast, it may be to the top of the said mast--and that, as well in letting them fly as in drawing them in to diminish their surface in reefing them. Thence the necessity of running out on foot-ropes--movable ropes stretched below the yards--of working with one hand while holding on by the other--perilous work for any one who is not used to it. The oscillation from the rolling and pitching of the ship, very much increased by the length of the lever, the flapping of the sails under a stiff breeze, have often sent a man overboard.",test,0,3,0,mainmast contrary fewer sails carries brigantine forestaffsail two masts stays support prow triple row triangular sails may set prow bowsprit extreme end hauled three jibs jibs brigantine forestaff staysails easily managed hoisted deck without necessity climbing masts fastened yards means ropebands must previously loosened contrary working foremast sails demands much greater proficiency seamanship fact necessary set sailors must climb riggingit may foretop may spars topgallant mast may top said mastand well letting fly drawing diminish surface reefing necessity running footropesmovable ropes stretched yardsof working one hand holding otherperilous work one used oscillation rolling pitching ship much increased length lever flapping sails stiff breeze often sent man overboard
4743,"It was then a truly dangerous operation for Tom and his companions. Very fortunately, the wind was moderate. The sea had not yet had time to become rough. The rolling and pitching kept within bounds. When Dick Sand, at Captain Hull's signal, had steered toward the scene of the catastrophe, the ""Pilgrim"" only carried her jibs, her brigantine, her foresail, and her top-sail. To get the ship under way as quickly as possible, the novice had only to make use of, that is, to counter-brace, the foresail. The blacks had easily helped him in that maneuver. The question now was to get under full sail, and, to complete the sails, to hoist the top-sails, the royal, the fore-staff, and the stay-sails. ""My friends,"" said the novice to the five blacks, ""do as I tell you, and all will go right"". Dick Sand was standing at the wheel of the helm.",test,0,1,0,truly dangerous operation companions fortunately wind moderate sea yet time become rough rolling pitching kept within bounds signal steered toward scene catastrophe carried jibs brigantine foresail topsail get ship way quickly possible novice make use counterbrace foresail blacks easily helped maneuver question get full sail complete sails hoist topsails royal forestaff staysails friends said novice five blacks tell go right standing wheel helm
4744,"""Go""! cried he. ""Tom, let go that rope quickly""! ""Let go""? said Tom, who did not understand that expression. ""Yes, loosen it! Now you, Bat--the same thing! Good! Heave--haul taut.

4747,"And the whole breadth of the foremast, whose larboard braces had been loosened, turned slowly. The wind then swelling the sails imparted a certain speed to the ship. Dick Sand then had the jib sheet-ropes loosened. Then he called the blacks aft:  ""Behold what is done, my friends, and well done. Now let us attend to the mainmast. But break nothing, Hercules"". ""I shall try,"" replied the colossus, without being willing to promise more. This second operation was quite easy. The main-boom sheet-rope having been let go gently, the brigantine took the wind more regularly, and added its powerful action to that of the forward sails. The fore-staff was then set above the brigantine, and, as it is simply brailed up, there was nothing to do but bear on the rope, to haul aboard, then to secure it.",test,0,1,0,whole breadth foremast whose larboard braces loosened turned slowly wind swelling sails imparted certain speed ship jib sheetropes loosened called blacks aft done friends well done let us attend mainmast break nothing shall try replied colossus without willing promise second operation quite easy mainboom sheetrope let go gently brigantine took wind regularly added powerful action forward sails forestaff set brigantine simply brailed nothing bear rope haul aboard secure
4748,"But Hercules pulled so hard, along with his friend Acteon, without counting little Jack, who had joined them, that the rope broke off. All three fell backwards--happily, without hurting themselves. Jack was enchanted. ""That's nothing! that's nothing""! cried the novice. ""Fasten the two ends together for this time and hoist softly""! That was done under Dick Sand's eyes, while he had not yet left the helm. The ""Pilgrim"" was already sailing rapidly, headed to the east, and there was nothing more to be done but keep it in that direction. Nothing easier, because the wind was favorable, and lurches were not to be feared.",test,0,1,0,pulled hard along friend without counting little joined rope broke three fell backwardshappily without hurting enchanted nothing thats nothing cried novice two ends together time hoist softly done eyes yet left helm already sailing rapidly headed east nothing done keep direction easier wind favorable lurches feared

Mrs. Weldon also complimented those honest men. Little Jack himself received his share of praise, for he had worked bravely. ""Indeed, I believe, Mr. Jack,"" said Hercules, smiling, ""that it was you who broke the rope. What a good little fist you have. Without you we should have done nothing right"". And little Jack, very proud of himself, shook his friend Hercules' hand vigorously.",test,0,4,1,friends said novice good sailors end voyage shall best replied also complimented honest men received share praise worked bravely believe said smiling broke rope good little fist done nothing right little proud shook friend hand vigorously
4750,"The setting of the ""Pilgrim's"" sails was not yet complete. She still lacked those top-sails whose action is not to be despised under this full-sail movement. Top-sail, royal, stay-sails, would add sensibly to the schooner's speed, and Dick Sand resolved to set them. This operation would be more difficult than the others, not for the stay-sails, which could be hoisted, hauled aboard and fastened from below, but for the cross-jacks of the foremast. It was necessary to climb to the spars to let them out, and Dick Sand, not wishing to expose any one of his improvised crew, undertook to do it himself. He then called Tom and put him at the wheel, showing him how he should keep the ship. Then Hercules, Bat, Acteon and Austin being placed, some at the royal halyards, others at those of the top-sails, he proceeded up the mast. To climb the rattlings of the fore-shrouds, then the rattlings of the topmast-shrouds, to gain the spars, that was only play for the young novice. In a minute he was on the foot-rope of the top-sail yard, and he let go the rope-bands which kept the sail bound. Then he stood on the spars again and climbed on the royal yard, where he let out the sail rapidly.",test,0,2,0,setting sails yet complete still lacked topsails whose action despised fullsail movement royal staysails would add sensibly schooners speed resolved set operation would difficult others staysails could hoisted hauled aboard fastened crossjacks foremast necessary climb spars let wishing expose one improvised crew undertook called put wheel showing keep ship placed royal halyards others topsails proceeded mast climb rattlings foreshrouds rattlings topmastshrouds gain spars play young novice minute footrope topsail yard let go ropebands kept sail bound stood spars climbed royal yard let sail rapidly
4751,"Dick Sand had finished his task, and seizing one of the starboard backstays, he slid to the deck. There, under his directions, the two sails were vigorously hauled and fastened, then the two yards hoisted to the block. The stay-sails being set next between the mainmast and the foremast, the work was finished. Hercules had broken nothing this time. The ""Pilgrim"" then carried all the sails that composed her rigging. Doubtless Dick Sand could still add the foremast studding-sails to larboard, but it was difficult work under the present circumstances, and should it be necessary to take them in, in case of a squall, it could not be done fast enough. So the novice stopped there. Tom was relieved from his post at the wheel, which Dick Sand took charge of again. The breeze freshened. The ""Pilgrim,"" making a slight turn to starboard, glided rapidly over the surface of the sea, leaving behind her a very flat track, which bore witness to the purity of her water-line.",test,0,2,0,finished task seizing one starboard backstays slid deck directions two sails vigorously hauled fastened two yards hoisted block staysails set next mainmast foremast work finished broken nothing time carried sails composed rigging could still add foremast studdingsails larboard difficult work present circumstances necessary take case squall could done fast enough novice stopped relieved post wheel took charge breeze freshened making slight turn starboard glided rapidly surface sea leaving behind flat track bore witness purity waterline
4752,"""We are well under way, Mrs. Weldon,"" then said Dick Sand, ""and, now, may God preserve this favorable wind""! Mrs. Weldon pressed the young man's hand. Then, fatigued with all the emotions of that last hour, she sought her cabin, and fell into a sort of painful drowsiness, which was not sleep. The new crew remained on the schooner's deck, watching on the forecastle, and ready to obey Dick Sand's orders--that is to say, to change the set of the sails according to the variations of the wind; but so long as the breeze kept both that force and that direction, there would be positively nothing to do. During all this time what had become of Cousin Benedict? Cousin Benedict was occupied in studying with a magnifying glass an articulate which he had at last found on board--a simple orthopter, whose head disappeared under the prothorax; an insect with flat elytrums, with round abdomen, with rather long wings, which belonged to the family of the roaches, and to the species of American cockroaches. It was exactly while ferreting in Negoro's kitchen, that he had made that precious discovery, and at the moment when the cook was going to crush the said insect pitilessly. Thence anger, which, indeed, Negoro took no notice of. But this Cousin Benedict, did he know what change had taken place on board since the moment when Captain Hull and his companions had commenced that fatal whale-fishing? Yes, certainly.",test,0,3,0,well way said may preserve favorable wind pressed young mans hand fatigued emotions last hour sought cabin fell sort painful drowsiness sleep new crew remained schooners deck watching forecastle ready obey ordersthat say change set sails according variations wind long breeze kept force direction would positively nothing time become occupied studying magnifying glass articulate last found boarda simple orthopter whose head disappeared prothorax insect flat elytrums round abdomen rather long wings belonged family roaches species cockroaches exactly ferreting kitchen made precious discovery moment cook going crush said insect pitilessly anger indeed took notice know change taken place board since moment companions commenced fatal whalefishing certainly
4753,"He was even on the deck when the ""Pilgrim"" arrived in sight of the remains of the whale-boat. The schooner's crew had then perished before his eyes. To pretend that this catastrophe had not affected him, would be to accuse his heart. That pity for others that all people feel, he had certainly experienced it. He was equally moved by his cousin's situation. He had come to press Mrs. Weldon's hand, as if to say to her: ""Do not be afraid. I am here. I am left to you"". Then Cousin Benedict had turned toward his cabin, doubtless so as to reflect on the consequences of this disastrous event, and on the energetic measures that he must take. But on his way he had met the cockroach in question, and his desire was--held, however, against certain entomologists--to prove the cockroaches of the phoraspe species, remarkable for their colors, have very different habits from cockroaches properly so called; he had given himself up to the study, forgetting both that there had been a Captain Hull in command of the ""Pilgrim,"" and that that unfortunate had just perished with his crew.",test,0,2,0,even deck arrived sight remains whaleboat schooners crew perished eyes pretend catastrophe affected would accuse heart pity others people feel certainly experienced equally moved cousins situation come press hand say afraid left turned toward cabin doubtless reflect consequences disastrous event energetic measures must take way met cockroach question desire washeld however certain entomologiststo prove cockroaches phoraspe species remarkable colors different habits cockroaches properly called given study forgetting command unfortunate perished crew
4754,"The cockroach absorbed him entirely. He did not admire it less, and he made as much time over it as if that horrible insect had been a golden beetle. The life on board had then returned to its usual course, though every one would remain for a long time yet under the effects of such a keen and unforeseen catastrophe. During this day Dick Sand was everywhere, so that everything should be in its place, and that he could be prepared for the smallest contingency. The blacks obeyed him with zeal. The most perfect order reigned on board the ""Pilgrim"". It might then be hoped that all would go well. On his side, Negoro made no other attempt to resist Dick Sand's authority. He appeared to have tacitly recognized him. Occupied as usual in his narrow kitchen, he was not seen more than before.",test,0,1,0,cockroach absorbed entirely admire less made much time horrible insect golden beetle life board returned usual course though every one would remain long time yet effects keen unforeseen catastrophe day everywhere everything place could prepared smallest contingency blacks obeyed zeal perfect order reigned board might hoped would go well side made attempt resist authority appeared tacitly recognized usual narrow kitchen seen
4755,"Besides, at the least infraction--at the first symptom of insubordination, Dick Sand was determined to send him to the hold for the rest of the passage. At a sign from him, Hercules would take the head cook by the skin of the neck; that would not have taken long. In that case, Nan, who knew how to cook, would replace the cook in his functions. Negoro then could say to himself that he was indispensable, and, as he was closely watched, he seemed unwilling to give any cause of complaint. The wind, though growing stronger till evening, did not necessitate any change in the ""Pilgrim's"" sails. Her solid masting, her iron rigging, which was in good condition, would enable her to bear in this condition even a stronger breeze. During the night it is often the custom to lessen the sails, and particularly to take in the high sails, fore-staff, top-sail, royal, etc. That is prudent, in case some squall of wind should come up suddenly. But Dick Sand believed he could dispense with this precaution. The state of the atmosphere indicated nothing of the kind, and besides, the young novice determined to pass the first night on the deck, intending to have an eye to everything.",test,0,2,0,least infractionat first symptom insubordination determined send hold rest passage sign would take head cook skin neck would taken long case knew cook would replace cook functions could say indispensable closely watched seemed unwilling give cause complaint wind though growing stronger till evening necessitate change sails solid masting iron rigging good condition would enable bear condition even stronger breeze night often custom lessen sails particularly take high sails forestaff topsail royal etc prudent case squall wind come suddenly believed could dispense precaution state atmosphere indicated nothing kind besides young novice determined pass first night deck intending eye everything
4756,"Then the progress was more rapid, and he longed to be in less desolate parts. It has been said that the log and the compass were the only instruments which Dick Sand could use, so as to estimate approximately the way made by the ""Pilgrim"". During this day the novice threw the log every half-hour, and he noted the indications furnished by the instrument. As to the instrument which bears the name of compass, there were two on board. One was placed in the binnacle, under the eyes of the man at the helm. Its dial, lighted by day by the diurnal light, by night by two side-lamps, indicated at every moment which way the ship headed--that is, the direction she followed. The other compass was an inverted one, fixed to the bars of the cabin which Captain Hull formerly occupied. By that means, without leaving his chamber, he could always know if the route given was exactly followed, if the man at the helm, from ignorance or negligence, allowed the ship to make too great lurches. Besides, there is no ship employed in long voyages which does not possess at least two compasses, as she has two chronometers. It is necessary to compare these instruments with each other, and, consequently, control their indications.",test,0,2,0,progress rapid longed less desolate parts said log compass instruments could use estimate approximately way made day novice threw log every halfhour noted indications furnished instrument instrument bears name compass two board placed binnacle eyes man helm dial lighted day diurnal light night two sidelamps indicated every moment way ship headedthat direction followed compass inverted one fixed bars cabin formerly occupied means without leaving chamber could always know route given exactly followed man helm ignorance negligence allowed ship make great lurches ship employed long voyages possess least two compasses two chronometers necessary compare instruments consequently control indications
4757,"The ""Pilgrim"" was then sufficiently provided for in that respect, and Dick Sand charged his men to take the greatest care of the two compasses, which were so necessary to him. Now, unfortunately, during the night of the 12th to the 13th of February, while the novice was on watch, and holding the wheel of the helm, a sad accident took place. The inverted compass, which was fastened by a copper ferule to the woodwork of the cabin, broke off and fell on the floor. It was not seen till the next day. How had the ferule come to break. It was inexplicable enough. It was possible, however, that it was oxydized, and that the pitching and rolling had broken it from the woodwork. Now, indeed, the sea had been rougher during the night. However it was, the compass was broken in such a manner that it could not be repaired. Dick Sand was much thwarted.",test,0,1,0,sufficiently provided respect charged men take greatest care two compasses necessary unfortunately night novice watch holding wheel helm sad accident took place inverted compass fastened copper ferule woodwork cabin broke fell floor seen till next day ferule come break inexplicable enough possible however oxydized pitching rolling broken woodwork indeed sea rougher night compass broken manner could repaired much thwarted
4758,"Henceforth he was reduced to trust solely to the compass in the binnacle. Very evidently no one was responsible for the breaking of the second compass, but it might have sad consequences. The novice then took every precaution to keep the other compass beyond the reach of every accident. Till then, with that exception, all went well on board the ""Pilgrim"". Mrs. Weldon, seeing Dick Sand's calmness, had regained confidence. It was not that she had ever yielded to despair. Above all, she counted on the goodness of God. Also, as a sincere and pious Catholic, she comforted herself by prayer. Dick Sand had arranged so as to remain at the helm during the night. He slept five or six hours in the day, and that seemed enough for him, as he did not feel too much fatigued.",test,0,1,0,reduced trust solely compass binnacle evidently one responsible breaking second compass might sad consequences novice took every precaution keep compass beyond reach every accident exception went well board seeing calmness regained confidence ever yielded despair counted goodness sincere pious comforted prayer arranged remain helm night slept five six hours day seemed enough feel much fatigued
4759,"During this time Tom or his son Bat took his place at the wheel of the helm, and, thanks to his counsels, they were gradually becoming passable steersmen. Often Mrs. Weldon and the novice talked to each other. Dick Sand willingly took advice from this intelligent and courageous woman. Each day he showed her on the ship's chart the course run, which he took by reckoning, taking into account only the direction and the speed of the ship. ""See, Mrs. Weldon,"" he often repeated to her, ""with these winds blowing, we cannot fail to reach the coast of South America. I should not like to affirm it, but I verily believe that when our vessel shall arrive in sight of land, it will not be far from Valparaiso"". Mrs. Weldon could not doubt the direction of the vessel was right, favored above all by those winds from the northwest. But how far the ""Pilgrim"" still seemed to be from the American coast! How many dangers between her and the firm land, only counting those which might come from a change in the state of the sea and the sky!

4760,"He found, of course, that his friend Dick was less with him than formerly; but his mother had made him understand that they must leave the young novice entirely to his occupations. Little Jack had given up to these reasons, and no longer disturbed ""Captain Sand"". So passed life on board. The blacks did their work intelligently, and each day became more skilful in the sailor's craft. Tom was naturally the boatswain, and it was he, indeed, whom his companions would have chosen for that office. He commanded the watch while the novice rested, and he had with him his son Bat and Austin. Acteon and Hercules formed the other watch, under Dick Sand's direction. By this means, while one steered, the others watched at the prow. Even though these parts were deserted, and no collision was really to be feared, the novice exacted a rigorous watch during the night. He never sailed without having his lights in position--a green light on the starboard, a red light on the larboard--and in that he acted wisely.",test,0,2,0,found course friend less formerly mother made understand must leave young novice entirely occupations given reasons longer disturbed passed life board blacks work intelligently day became skilful sailors craft naturally boatswain indeed companions would chosen office commanded watch novice rested son formed watch direction means one steered others watched prow though parts deserted collision really feared novice exacted rigorous watch night never sailed without lights positiona green light starboard red light larboardand acted wisely
4761,"All the time, during those nights which Dick Sand passed entirely at the helm, he occasionally felt an irresistible heaviness over him. His hand then steered by pure instinct. It was the effect of a fatigue of which he did not wish to take account. Now, it happened that during the night of the 13th to the 14th of February, that Dick Sand was very tired, and was obliged to take a few hours' rest. He was replaced at the helm by old Tom. The sky was covered with thick clouds, which had gathered with the evening, under the influence of the cold air. It was then very dark, and it was impossible to distinguish the high sails lost in the darkness. Hercules and Acteon were on watch on the forecastle. Aft, the light from the binnacle only gave a faint gleam, which the metallic apparatus of the wheel reflected softly. The ship's lanterns throwing their lights laterally, left the deck of the vessel in profound darkness.",test,0,2,0,time nights passed entirely helm occasionally felt irresistible heaviness hand steered pure instinct effect fatigue wish take account happened night tired obliged take hours rest replaced helm old sky covered thick clouds gathered evening influence cold air dark impossible distinguish high sails lost darkness watch forecastle light binnacle gave faint gleam metallic apparatus wheel reflected softly ships lanterns throwing lights laterally left deck vessel profound darkness
4762,"Toward three o'clock in the morning, a kind of hypnotic phenomenon took place, of which old Tom was not even conscious. His eves, which were fixed too long on a luminous point of the binnacle, suddenly lost the power of vision, and he fell into a true anæsthetic sleep. Not only was he incapable of seeing, but if one had touched or pinched him hard he would probably have felt nothing. So he did not see a shadow which glided over the deck. It was Negoro. Arrived aft, the head cook placed under the binnacle a pretty heavy object which he held in hand. Then, after observing for an instant the luminous index of the compass, he retired without having been seen. If, the next day, Dick Sand had perceived that object placed by Negoro under the binnacle, he might have hastened to take it away. In fact, it was a piece of iron, whose influence had just altered the indications of the compass. The magnetic needle had been deviated, and instead of marking the magnetic north, which differs a little from the north of the world, it marked the northeast.",test,0,2,0,three oclock morning kind hypnotic phenomenon took place old even conscious eves fixed long luminous point binnacle suddenly lost power vision fell true anæsthetic sleep incapable seeing one touched pinched hard would probably felt nothing see shadow glided deck aft head cook placed binnacle pretty heavy object held hand observing instant luminous index compass retired without seen next day perceived object placed binnacle might hastened take away fact piece iron whose influence altered indications compass magnetic needle deviated instead marking magnetic north differs little north world marked northeast
4763,"It was then, a deviation of four points; in other words, of half a right angle. Tom soon recovered from his drowsiness. His eyes were fixed on the compass. He believed, he had reason to believe, that the ""Pilgrim"" was not in the right direction. He then moved the helm so as to head the ship to the east--at least, he thought so. But, with the deviation of the needle, which he could not suspect, that point, changed by four points, was the southeast. And thus, while under the action of a favorable wind, the ""Pilgrim"" was supposed to follow the direction wished for, she sailed with an error of forty-five degrees in her route! CHAPTER XI.

4764,"The wind from the northwest freshened gradually, and the ""Pilgrim"" sailed rapidly, making on an average one hundred and sixty miles in twenty-four hours. It was nearly all that could be asked of a vessel of that size. Dick Sand thought the schooner must be approaching those parts more frequented by the merchant vessels which seek to pass from one hemisphere to the other. The novice was always hoping to encounter one of those ships, and he clearly intended either to transfer his passengers, or to borrow some additional sailors, and perhaps an officer. But, though he watched vigilantly, no ship could be signaled, and the sea was always deserted. Dick Sand continued to be somewhat astonished at that. He had crossed this part of the Pacific several times during his three fishing voyages to the Southern Seas. Now, in the latitude and longitude where his reckoning put him, it was seldom that some English or American ship did not appear, ascending from Cape Horn toward the equator, or coming toward the extreme point of South America. But what Dick Sand was ignorant of, what he could not even discover, was that the ""Pilgrim"" was already in higher latitude--that is to say, more to the south than he supposed. That was so for two reasons:  The first was, that the currents of these parts, whose swiftness the novice could only imperfectly estimate, had contributed--while he could not possibly keep account of them--to throw the ship out of her route.",test,0,2,0,wind northwest freshened gradually sailed rapidly making average one hundred sixty miles twentyfour hours nearly could asked vessel size thought schooner must approaching parts frequented merchant vessels seek pass one hemisphere novice always hoping encounter one ships clearly intended either transfer passengers borrow additional sailors perhaps officer though watched vigilantly ship could signaled sea always deserted continued somewhat astonished crossed part several times three fishing voyages latitude longitude reckoning put seldom ship appear ascending toward equator coming toward extreme point ignorant could even discover already higher latitudethat say south supposed two reasons first currents parts whose swiftness novice could imperfectly estimate contributedwhile could possibly keep account themto throw ship route
4765,"The second was, that the compass, made inaccurate by Negoro's guilty hand, henceforth only gave incorrect bearings--bearings that, since the loss of the second compass, Dick Sand could not control. So that, believing, and having reason to believe, that he was sailing eastward, in reality, he was sailing southeast. The compass, it was always before his eyes. The log, it was thrown regularly. His two instruments permitted him, in a certain measure, to direct the ""Pilgrim,"" and to estimate the number of miles sailed. But, then, was that sufficient? However, the novice always did his best to reassure Mrs. Weldon, whom the incidents of this voyage must at times render anxious. ""We shall arrive, we shall arrive""! he repeated. ""We shall reach the American coast, here or there; it matters little, on the whole, but we cannot fail to land there""!",test,0,1,0,second compass made inaccurate guilty hand henceforth gave incorrect bearingsbearings since loss second compass could control believing reason believe sailing eastward reality sailing southeast compass always eyes log thrown regularly two instruments permitted certain measure direct estimate number miles sailed sufficient novice always best reassure incidents voyage must times render anxious shall arrive shall arrive repeated shall reach coast matters little whole fail land
4766,"""I do not doubt it, Dick"". ""Of course, Mrs. Weldon, I should be more at ease if you were not on board--if we had only ourselves to answer for; but----""  ""But if I were not on board,"" replied Mrs. Weldon; ""if Cousin Benedict, Jack, Nan and I, had not taken passage on the 'Pilgrim,' and if, on the other hand, Tom and his companions had not been picked up at sea, Dick, there would be only two men here, you and Negoro! What would have become of you, alone with that wicked man, in whom you cannot have confidence? Yes, my child, what would have become of you""? ""I should have begun,"" replied Dick Sand, resolutely, ""by putting Negoro where he could not injure me"". ""And you would have worked alone""? ""Yes--alone--with the aid of God""! The firmness of these words was well calculated to encourage Mrs. Weldon. But, nevertheless, while thinking of her little Jack, she often felt uneasy.

4767,"Meanwhile, if the young novice was not sufficiently advanced in his hydrographic studies to make his point, he possessed a true sailor's scent, when the question was ""to tell the weather"". The appearance of the sky, for one thing; on the other hand, the indications of the barometer, enabled him to be on his guard. Captain Hull, a good meteorologist, had taught him to consult this instrument, whose prognostications are remarkably sure. Here is, in a few words, what the notices relative to the observation of the barometer contain:  1. When, after a rather long continuance of fine weather, the barometer begins to fall in a sudden and continuous manner, rain will certainly fall; but, if the fine weather has had a long duration, the mercury may fall two or three days in the tube of the barometer before any change in the state of the atmosphere may be perceived. Then, the longer the time between the falling of the mercury and the arrival of the rain, the longer will be the duration of rainy weather. 2. If, on the contrary, during a rainy period which has already had a long duration, the barometer commences to rise slowly and regularly, very certainly fine weather will come, and it will last much longer if a long interval elapses between its arrival and the rising of the barometer. 3. In the two cases given, if the change of weather follows immediately the movement of the barometrical column, that change will last only a very short time.",test,0,2,0,young novice sufficiently advanced hydrographic studies make point possessed true sailors scent question tell weather appearance sky one thing hand indications barometer enabled guard good meteorologist taught consult instrument whose prognostications remarkably sure words notices relative observation barometer contain rather long continuance fine weather barometer begins fall sudden continuous manner rain certainly fall fine weather long duration mercury may fall two three days tube barometer change state atmosphere may perceived longer time falling mercury arrival rain longer duration rainy weather contrary rainy period already long duration barometer commences rise slowly regularly certainly fine weather come last much longer long interval elapses arrival rising barometer two cases given change weather follows immediately movement barometrical column change last short time
4768,"4. If the barometer rises with slowness and in a continuous manner for two or three days, or even more, it announces fine weather, even when the rain will not cease during those three days, and _vice versa;_ but if the barometer rises two days or more during the rain, then, the fine weather having come, if it commences to fall again, the fine weather will last a very short time, and _vice versa_. 5. In the spring and in the autumn, a sudden fall of the barometer presages wind. In the summer, if the weather is very warm, it announces a storm. In winter, after a frost of some duration, a rapid falling of the barometrical column announces a change of wind, accompanied by a thaw and rain; but a rising which happens during a frost which has already lasted a certain time, prognosticates snow. 6. Rapid oscillations of the barometer should never be interpreted as presaging dry or rainy weather of any duration. Those indications are given exclusively by the rising or the falling which takes place in a slow and continuous manner. 7.",test,0,2,0,barometer rises slowness continuous manner two three days even announces fine weather even rain cease three days versa barometer rises two days rain fine weather come commences fall fine weather last short time versa spring autumn sudden fall barometer presages wind summer weather warm announces storm winter frost duration rapid falling barometrical column announces change wind accompanied thaw rain rising happens frost already lasted certain time prognosticates snow oscillations barometer never interpreted presaging dry rainy weather duration indications given exclusively rising falling takes place slow continuous manner
4769,"Toward the end of autumn, if after prolonged rainy and windy weather, the barometer begins to rise, that rising announces the passage of the wind to the north and the approach of the frost. Such are the general consequences to draw from the indications of this precious instrument. Dick Sand knew all that perfectly well, as he had ascertained for himself in different circumstances of his sailor's life, which made him very skilful in putting himself on his guard against all contingencies. Now, just toward the 20th of February, the oscillations of the barometrical column began to preoccupy the young novice, who noted them several times a day with much care. In fact, the barometer began to fall in a slow and continuous manner, which presages rain; but, this rain being delayed, Dick Sand concluded from that, that the bad weather would last. That is what must happen. But the rain was the wind, and in fact, at that date, the breeze freshened so much that the air was displaced with a velocity of sixty feet a second, say thirty-one miles an hour. Dick Sand was obliged to take some precautions so as not to risk the ""Pilgrim's"" masting and sails. Already he had the royal, the fore-staff, and the flying-jib taken in, and he resolved to do the same with the top-sail, then take in two reefs in the top-sail. This last operation must present certain difficulties with a crew of little experience.",test,0,2,0,end autumn prolonged rainy windy weather barometer begins rise rising announces passage wind north approach frost general consequences draw indications precious instrument knew perfectly well ascertained different circumstances sailors life made skilful putting guard contingencies toward oscillations barometrical column began preoccupy young novice noted several times day much care fact barometer began fall slow continuous manner presages rain rain delayed concluded bad weather would last must happen rain wind fact date breeze freshened much air displaced velocity sixty feet second say thirtyone miles hour obliged take precautions risk masting sails royal forestaff flyingjib taken resolved topsail take two reefs topsail last operation must present certain difficulties crew little experience
4770,"Hesitation would not do, however, and no one hesitated. Dick Sand, accompanied by Bat and Austin, climbed into the rigging of the foremast, and succeeded, not without trouble, in taking in the top-sail. In less threatening weather he would have left the two yards on the mast, but, foreseeing that he would probably be obliged to level that mast, and perhaps even to lay it down upon the deck, he unrigged the two yards and sent them to the deck. In fact, it is understood that when the wind becomes too strong, not only must the sails be diminished, but also the masting. That is a great relief to the ship, which, carrying less weight above, is no longer so much strained with the rolling and pitching. This first work accomplished--and it took two hours--Dick Sand and his companions were busy reducing the surface of the top-sail, by taking in two reefs. The ""Pilgrim"" did not carry, like the majority of modern ships, a double top-sail, which facilitates the operation. It was necessary, then, to work as formerly--that is to say, to run out on the foot-ropes, pull toward you a sail beaten by the wind, and lash it firmly with its reef-lines. It was difficult, long, perilous; but, finally, the diminished top-sail gave less surface to the wind, and the schooner was much relieved. Dick Sand came down again with Bat and Austin.",test,0,2,0,would however one hesitated accompanied climbed rigging foremast succeeded without trouble taking topsail less threatening weather would left two yards mast foreseeing would probably obliged level mast perhaps even lay upon deck unrigged two yards sent deck fact understood wind becomes strong must sails diminished also masting great relief ship carrying less weight longer much strained rolling pitching first work accomplishedand took two hoursdick companions busy reducing surface topsail taking two reefs carry like majority modern ships double topsail facilitates operation necessary work formerlythat say run footropes pull toward sail beaten wind lash firmly reeflines difficult long perilous finally diminished topsail gave less surface wind schooner much relieved came
4771,"The ""Pilgrim"" was then in the sailing condition demanded by that state of the atmosphere which has been qualified as ""very stiff"". During the three days which followed, 20th, 21st and 22d of February, the force and direction of the wind were not perceptibly changed. All the time the mercury continued to fall in the barometrical tube, and, on this last day, the novice noted that it kept continually below twenty-eight and seven-tenths inches. Besides, there was no appearance that the barometer would rise for some time. The aspect of the sky was bad, and extremely windy. Besides, thick fogs covered it constantly. Their stratum was even so deep that the sun was no longer seen, and it would have been difficult to indicate precisely the place of his setting and rising. Dick Sand began to be anxious. He no longer left the deck; he hardly slept. However, his moral energy enabled him to drive back his fears to the bottom of his heart.",test,0,1,0,sailing condition demanded state atmosphere qualified stiff three days followed force direction wind perceptibly changed time mercury continued fall barometrical tube last day novice noted kept continually twentyeight seventenths inches appearance barometer would rise time aspect sky bad extremely windy thick fogs covered constantly stratum even deep sun longer seen would difficult indicate precisely place setting rising began anxious longer left deck hardly slept moral energy enabled drive back fears bottom heart
4772,"The next day, February 22d, the breeze appeared to decrease a little in the morning, but Dick Sand did not trust in it. He was right, for in the afternoon the wind freshened again, and the sea became rougher. Toward four o'clock, Negoro, who was rarely seen, left his post and came up on the forecastle. Dingo, doubtless, was sleeping in some corner, for it did not bark as usual. Negoro, always silent, remained for half an hour observing the horizon. Long surges succeeded each other without, as yet, being dashed together. However, they were higher than the force of the wind accounted for. One must conclude from that, that there was very bad weather in the west, perhaps at a rather short distance, and that it would not be long in reaching these parts. Negoro watched that vast extent of sea, which was greatly troubled, around the ""Pilgrim"". Then his eyes, always cold and dry, turned toward the sky.",test,0,1,0,next day breeze appeared decrease little morning trust right afternoon wind freshened sea became rougher four oclock rarely seen left post came forecastle doubtless sleeping corner bark usual always silent remained half hour observing horizon surges succeeded without yet dashed together higher force wind accounted must conclude bad weather west perhaps rather short distance would long reaching parts watched vast extent sea greatly troubled around eyes always cold dry turned toward sky
4773,"The aspect of the sky was disturbing. The vapors moved with very different velocities. The clouds of the upper zone traveled more rapidly than those of the low strata of the atmosphere. The case then must be foreseen, in which those heavy masses would fall, and might change into a tempest, perhaps a hurricane, what was yet only a very stiff breeze--that is to say, a displacement of the air at the rate of forty-three miles an hour. Whether Negoro was not a man to be frightened, or whether he understood nothing of the threats of the weather, he did not appear to be affected. However, an evil smile glided over his lips. One would say, at the end of his observations, that this state of things was rather calculated to please him than to displease him. One moment he mounted on the bowsprit and crawled as far as the ropes, so as to extend his range of vision, as if he were seeking some indication on the horizon. Then he descended again, and tranquilly, without having pronounced a single word, without having made a gesture, he regained the crew's quarters. Meanwhile, in the midst of all these fearful conjunctions, there remained one happy circumstance which each one on board ought to remember; it was that this wind, violent as it was or might become, was favorable, and that the ""Pilgrim"" seemed to be rapidly making the American coast.",test,0,2,0,aspect sky disturbing vapors moved different velocities clouds upper zone traveled rapidly low strata atmosphere case must foreseen heavy masses would fall might change tempest perhaps hurricane yet stiff breezethat say displacement air rate fortythree miles hour man frightened whether understood nothing threats weather appear affected evil smile glided lips would say end observations state things rather calculated please displease moment mounted bowsprit crawled far ropes extend range vision seeking indication horizon descended tranquilly without pronounced single word without made gesture regained crews quarters midst fearful conjunctions remained one happy circumstance one board ought remember wind violent might become favorable seemed rapidly making coast
4774,"If, indeed, the weather did not turn to tempest, this navigation would continue to be accomplished without great danger, and the veritable perils would only spring up when the question would be to land on some badly ascertained point of the coast. That was indeed what Dick Sand was already asking himself. When he should once make the land, how should he act, if he did not encounter some pilot, some one who knew the coast? In case the bad weather should oblige him to seek a port of refuge, what should he do, because that coast was to him absolutely unknown? Indeed, he had not yet to trouble himself with that contingency. However, when the hour should come, he would be obliged to adopt some plan. Well, Dick Sand adopted one. During the thirteen days which elapsed, from the 24th of February to the 9th of March, the state of the atmosphere did not change in any perceptible manner. The sky was always loaded with heavy fogs. For a few hours the wind went down, then it began to blow again with the same force.",test,0,2,0,indeed weather turn tempest navigation would continue accomplished without great danger veritable perils would spring question would land badly ascertained point coast indeed already asking make land act encounter pilot one knew coast case bad weather oblige seek port refuge coast absolutely unknown yet trouble contingency hour come would obliged adopt plan adopted one thirteen days elapsed state atmosphere change perceptible manner sky always loaded heavy fogs hours wind went began blow force
4775,"Two or three times the barometer rose again, but its oscillation, comprising a dozen lines, was too sudden to announce a change of weather and a return of more manageable winds. Besides the barometrical column fell again almost immediately, and nothing could inspire any hope of the end of that bad weather within a short period. Terrible storms burst forth also, which very seriously disturbed Dick Sand. Two or three times the lightning struck the waves only a few cable-lengths from the ship. Then the rain fell in torrents, and made those whirlpools of half condensed vapors, which surrounded the ""Pilgrim"" with a thick mist. For entire hours the man at the lookout saw nothing, and the ship sailed at random. Even though the ship, although resting firmly on the waves, was horribly shaken, Mrs. Weldon, fortunately, supported this rolling and pitching without being incommoded. But her little boy was very much tried, and she was obliged to give him all her care. As to Cousin Benedict, he was no more sick than the American cockroaches which he made his society, and he passed his time in studying, as if he were quietly settled in his study in San Francisco. Very fortunately, also, Tom and his companions found themselves little sensitive to sea-sickness, and they could continue to come to the young novice's aid--well accustomed, himself, to all those excessive movements of a ship which flies before the weather.",test,0,2,0,three times barometer rose oscillation comprising dozen lines sudden announce change weather return manageable winds barometrical column fell almost immediately nothing could inspire hope end bad weather within short period storms burst forth also seriously disturbed three times lightning struck waves cablelengths ship rain fell torrents made whirlpools half condensed vapors surrounded thick mist entire hours man lookout saw nothing ship sailed random though ship although resting firmly waves horribly shaken fortunately supported rolling pitching without incommoded little boy much tried obliged give care sick cockroaches made society passed time studying quietly settled study fortunately also companions found little sensitive seasickness could continue come young novices aidwell accustomed excessive movements ship flies weather
4776,"The ""Pilgrim"" ran rapidly under this reduced sail, and already Dick Sand foresaw that he would be obliged to reduce it again. But he wished to hold out as long as it would be possible to do so without danger. According to his reckoning, the coast ought to be no longer distant. So they watched with care. All the time the novice could hardly trust his companions' eyes to discover the first indications of land. In fact, no matter what good sight he may have, he who is not accustomed to interrogating the sea horizons is not skilful in distinguishing the first contours of a coast, above all in the middle of fogs. So Dick Sand must watch himself, and he often climbed as far as the spars to see better. But no sign yet of the American coast. This astonished him, and Mrs. Weldon, by some words which escaped him, understood that astonishment.

4777,"The novice kept at the prow, sometimes observing the sea and the sky, sometimes looking at the ""Pilgrim's"" masting, which began to strain under the force of the wind. ""You see nothing yet, Dick""? she asked him, at a moment when he had just left the long lookout. ""Nothing, Mrs. Weldon, nothing,"" replied the novice; and meanwhile, the horizon seems to clear a little under this violent wind, which is going to blow still harder"". ""And, according to you, Dick, the American coast ought not to be distant now"". ""It cannot be, Mrs. Weldon, and if anything astonishes me, it is not having made it yet"". ""Meanwhile,"" continued Mrs. Weldon, ""the ship has always followed the right course"". ""Always, since the wind settled in the northwest,"" replied Dick Sand; ""that is to say, since the day when we lost our unfortunate captain and his crew. That was the 10th of February.

4778,"There have been then, twenty-seven since that"". ""But at that period what distance were we from the coast""? asked Mrs. Weldon. ""About four thousand five hundred miles, Mrs. Weldon. If there are things about which I have more than a doubt, I can at least guarantee this figure within about twenty miles"". ""And what has been the ship's speed""? ""On an average, a hundred and eighty miles a day since the wind freshened,"" replied the novice. ""So, I am surprised at not being in sight of land. And, what is still more extraordinary, is that we do not meet even a single one of those vessels which generally frequent these parts""!

Wait, I am going to have it thrown anew, and you will see that we are sailing at this moment at the rate of ten miles an hour, which would give us more than two hundred miles a day"". Dick Sand called Tom, and gave him the order to throw the log, an operation to which the old black was now quite accustomed. The log, firmly fastened to the end of the line, was brought and sent out. Twenty-five fathoms were hardly unrolled, when the rope suddenly slackened between Tom's hands. ""Ah!

And, nevertheless, that rope was of the first quality.",test,0,4,0,rope broken cried log lost showed end rope remained hand true fastening failed rope broken middle nevertheless rope first quality
4781,"It must have been, then, that the strands of the rope at the point of rupture were singularly worn! They were, in fact, and Dick Sand could tell that when he had the end of the rope in his hands! But had they become so by use? was what the novice, become suspicious, asked himself. However that was, the log was now lost, and Dick Sand had no longer any means of telling exactly the speed of his ship. In the way of instruments, he only possessed one compass, and he did not know that its indications were false. Mrs. Weldon saw him so saddened by this accident, that she did not wish to insist, and, with a very heavy heart, she retired into her cabin. But if the ""Pilgrim's"" speed and consequently the way sailed over could no longer be estimated, it was easy to tell that the ship's headway was not diminishing. In fact, the next day, March 10th, the barometer fell to twenty-eight and two-tenths inches. It was the announcement of one of those blasts of wind which travel as much as sixty miles an hour.",test,0,2,0,must strands rope point rupture singularly worn fact could tell end rope hands become use novice become suspicious asked log lost longer means telling exactly speed ship way instruments possessed one compass know indications false saw saddened accident wish insist heavy heart retired cabin speed consequently way sailed could longer estimated easy tell ships headway diminishing fact next day barometer fell twentyeight twotenths inches announcement one blasts wind travel much sixty miles hour
4782,"It became urgent to change once more the state of the sails, so as not to risk the security of the vessel. Dick Sand resolved to bring down his top-gallant mast and his fore-staff, and to furl his low sails, so as to sail under his foretop-mast stay-sail and the low reef of his top-sail. He called Tom and his companions to help him in that difficult operation, which, unfortunately, could not be executed with rapidity. And meanwhile time pressed, for the tempest already declared itself with violence. Dick Sands, Austin, Acteon, and Bat climbed into the masting, while Tom remained at the wheel, and Hercules on the deck, so as to slacken the ropes, as soon as he was commanded. After numerous efforts, the fore-staff and the top-gallant mast were gotten down upon the deck, not without these honest men having a hundred times risked being precipitated into the sea, the rolling shook the masting to such an extent. Then, the top-sail having been lessened and the foresail furled, the schooner carried only her foretop-mast stay-sail and the low reef of the top-sail. Even though her sails were then extremely reduced, the ""Pilgrim"" continued, none the less, to sail with excessive velocity. The 12th the weather took a still worse appearance. On that day, at dawn, Dick Sand saw, not without terror, the barometer fall to twenty-seven and nine-tenths inches.",test,0,2,0,became urgent change state sails risk security vessel resolved bring topgallant mast forestaff furl low sails sail foretopmast staysail low reef topsail called companions help difficult operation unfortunately could executed rapidity meanwhile time pressed tempest already declared violence climbed masting remained wheel deck slacken ropes soon commanded numerous efforts forestaff topgallant mast gotten upon deck without honest men hundred times risked precipitated sea rolling shook masting extent topsail lessened foresail furled schooner carried foretopmast staysail low reef topsail though sails extremely reduced continued none less sail excessive velocity weather took still worse appearance day dawn saw without terror barometer fall twentyseven ninetenths inches
4783,"It was a real tempest which was raging, and such that the ""Pilgrim"" could not carry even the little sail she had left. Dick Sand, seeing that his top-sail was going to be torn, gave the order to furl. But it was in vain. A more violent gust struck the ship at that moment, and tore off the sail. Austin, who was on the yard of the foretop-sail, was struck by the larboard sheet-rope. Wounded, but rather slightly, he could climb down again to the deck. Dick Sand, extremely anxious, had but one thought. It was that the ship, urged with such fury, was going to be dashed to pieces every moment; for, according to his calculation, the rocks of the coast could not be distant. He then returned to the prow, but he saw nothing which had the appearance of land, and then, came back to the wheel.

4784,"There, suddenly, as if in spite of himself, his arm was extended toward a point of the horizon. One would say that he recognized some high land in the fogs! Still, once more he smiled wickedly, and without saying anything of what he had been able to see, he returned to his post. *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER XII. ON THE HORIZON. At that date the tempest took its most terrible form, that of the hurricane. The wind had set in from the southwest. The air moved with a velocity of ninety miles an hour. It was indeed a hurricane, in fact, one of those terrible windstorms which wrecks all the ships of a roadstead, and which, even on land, the most solid structures cannot resist. Such was the one which, on the 25th of July, 1825, devastated Guadaloupe.",test,0,1,0,suddenly spite arm extended toward point horizon would say recognized high land fogs smiled wickedly without saying anything able see returned post date tempest took terrible form hurricane wind set southwest air moved velocity ninety miles hour indeed hurricane fact one terrible windstorms wrecks ships roadstead even land solid structures resist one devastated
4785,"When heavy cannons, carrying balls of twenty-four pounds, are raised from their carriages, one may imagine what would become of a ship which has no other point of support than an unsteady sea? And meanwhile, it is to its mobility alone that she may owe her salvation. She yields to the wind, and, provided she is strongly built, she is in a condition to brave the most violent surges. That was the case with the ""Pilgrim"". A few minutes after the top-sail had been torn in pieces, the foretop-mast stay-sail was in its turn torn off. Dick Sand must then give up the idea of setting even a storm-jib--a small sail of strong linen, which would make the ship easier to govern. The ""Pilgrim"" then ran without canvas, but the wind took effect on her hull, her masts, her rigging, and nothing more was needed to impart to her an excessive velocity. Sometimes even she seemed to emerge from the waves, and it was to be believed that she hardly grazed them. Under these circumstances, the rolling of the ship, tossed about on the enormous billows raised by the tempest, was frightful. There was danger of receiving some monstrous surge aft.",test,0,2,2,heavy cannons carrying balls twentyfour pounds raised carriages one may imagine would become ship point support unsteady sea meanwhile mobility alone may owe salvation yields wind provided strongly built condition brave violent surges case minutes topsail torn pieces foretopmast staysail turn torn must give idea setting even stormjiba small sail strong linen would make ship easier govern ran without canvas wind took effect hull masts rigging nothing needed impart excessive velocity even seemed emerge waves believed hardly grazed circumstances rolling ship tossed enormous billows raised tempest frightful danger receiving monstrous surge aft
4786,"Those mountains of water ran faster than the schooner, threatening to strike her stern if she did not rise pretty fast. That is extreme danger for every ship which scuds before the tempest. But what could be done to ward off that contingency? Greater speed could not be imparted to the ""Pilgrim,"" because she would not have kept the smallest piece of canvas. She must then be managed as much as possible by means of the helm, whose action was often powerless. Dick Sand no longer left the helm. He was lashed by the waist, so as not to be carried away by some surge. Tom and Bat, fastened also, stood near to help him. Hercules and Acteon, bound to the bitts, watched forward. As to Mrs. Weldon, to Little Jack, to Cousin Benedict, to Nan, they remained, by order of the novice, in the aft cabins.",test,0,1,0,mountains water ran faster schooner threatening strike stern rise pretty fast extreme danger every ship scuds tempest could done ward contingency speed could imparted would kept smallest piece canvas must managed much possible means helm whose action often powerless longer left helm lashed waist carried away surge fastened also stood near help bound bitts watched forward remained order novice aft cabins
4787,"Mrs. Weldon would have preferred to have remained on deck, but Dick Sand was strongly opposed to it; it would be exposing herself uselessly. All the scuttles had been hermetically nailed up. It was hoped that they would resist if some formidable billow should fall on the ship. If, by any mischance, they should yield under the weight of these avalanches, the ship might fill and sink. Very fortunately, also, the stowage had been well attended to, so that, notwithstanding the terrible tossing of the vessel, her cargo was not moved about. Dick Sand had again reduced the number of hours which he gave to sleep. So Mrs. Weldon began to fear that he would take sick. She made him consent to take some repose. Now, it was while he was still lying down, during the night of the 13th to the 14th of March, that a new incident took place. Tom and Bat were aft, when Negoro, who rarely appeared on that part of the deck, drew near, and even seemed to wish to enter into conversation with them; but Tom and his son did not reply to him.",test,0,2,0,would preferred remained deck strongly opposed would exposing uselessly scuttles hermetically nailed hoped would resist formidable billow fall ship mischance yield weight avalanches ship might fill sink fortunately also stowage well attended notwithstanding terrible tossing vessel cargo moved reduced number hours gave sleep began fear would take sick made consent take repose still lying night new incident took place aft rarely appeared part deck drew near even seemed wish enter conversation son reply
4788,"Suddenly, in a violent rolling of the ship, Negoro fell, and he would, doubtless, have been thrown into the sea if he had not held on to the binnacle. Tom gave a cry, fearing the compass would be broken. Dick Sand, in a moment of wakefulness, heard that cry, and rushing out of his quarters, he ran aft. Negoro had already risen, but he held in his hand the piece of iron which he had just taken from under the binnacle, and he hid it before Dick Sand could see it. Was it, then, Negoro's interest for the magnetic needle to return to its true direction? Yes, for these southwest winds served him now! ""What's the matter""? asked the novice. ""It's that cook of misfortune, who has just fallen on the compass""! replied Tom.",test,0,1,0,violent rolling ship fell would doubtless thrown sea held binnacle gave cry fearing compass would broken moment wakefulness heard cry rushing quarters ran aft already risen held hand piece iron taken binnacle hid could see interest magnetic needle return true direction southwest winds served matter asked novice cook misfortune fallen compass replied
4789,"At those words Dick Sand, in the greatest anxiety, leaned over the binnacle. It was in good condition; the compass, lighted by two lamps, rested as usual on its concentric circles. The young novice was greatly affected. The breaking of the only compass on board would be an irreparable misfortune. But what Dick Sand could not observe was that, since the taking away of the piece of iron, the needle had returned to its normal position, and indicated exactly the magnetic north as it ought to be under that meridian. Meanwhile, if Negoro could not be made responsible for a fall which seemed to be involuntary, Dick Sand had reason to be astonished that he was, at that hour, aft in the ship. ""What are you doing there""? he asked him. ""What I please,"" replied Negoro. ""You say----"" cried Dick Sand, who could not restrain his anger.",test,0,1,0,words greatest anxiety leaned binnacle good condition compass lighted two lamps rested usual concentric circles young novice greatly affected breaking compass board would irreparable misfortune could observe since taking away piece iron needle returned normal position indicated exactly magnetic north ought meridian could made responsible fall seemed involuntary reason astonished hour aft ship asked please replied say cried could restrain anger
4790,"""I say,"" replied the head cook, ""that there is no rule which forbids walking aft"". ""Well, I make that the rule,"" replied Dick Sand, ""and I forbid you, remember, to come aft"". ""Indeed""! replied Negoro. That man, so entirely under self-control, then made a menacing gesture. The novice drew a revolver from his pocket, and pointed it at the head cook. ""Negoro,"" said he, ""recollect that I am never without this revolver, and that on the first act of insubordination I shall blow out your brains""! At that moment Negoro felt himself irresistibly bent to the deck. It was Hercules, who had just simply laid his heavy hand on Negoro's shoulder. ""Captain Sand,"" said the giant, ""do you want me to throw this rascal overboard?",test,0,1,1,say replied head cook rule forbids walking aft make rule replied forbid remember come aft replied man entirely selfcontrol made menacing gesture novice drew revolver pocket pointed head cook said never without revolver first act insubordination shall blow brains moment felt irresistibly bent deck simply laid heavy hand shoulder said giant want throw rascal overboard
4791,"He will regale the fishes, who are not hard to please""! ""Not yet,"" replied Dick Sand. Negoro rose as soon as the black's hand no longer weighed upon him. But, in passing Hercules:  ""Accursed negro,"" murmured he, ""I'll pay you back""! Meanwhile, the wind had just changed; at least, it seemed to have veered round forty-five degrees. And, notwithstanding, a singular thing, which struck the novice, nothing in the condition of the sea indicated that change. The ship headed the same way all the time, but the wind and the waves, instead of taking her directly aft, now struck her by the larboard quarter--a very dangerous situation, which exposes a ship to receive bad surges. So Dick Sand was obliged to veer round four points to continue to scud before the tempest. But, on the other hand, his attention was awakened more than ever. He asked himself if there was not some connection between Negoro's fall and the breaking of the first compass.",test,0,2,0,regale fishes hard please yet replied rose soon blacks hand longer weighed upon passing negro murmured pay back wind changed least seemed veered round fortyfive degrees notwithstanding singular thing struck novice nothing condition sea indicated change ship headed way time wind waves instead taking directly aft struck larboard quartera dangerous situation exposes ship receive bad surges obliged veer round four points continue scud tempest hand attention awakened ever asked connection fall breaking first compass
4792,"What did the head cook intend to do there? Had he some interest in putting the second compass out of service also? What could that interest be? There was no explanation of that. Must not Negoro desire, as they all desired, to land on the American coast as soon as possible? When Dick Sand spoke of this incident to Mrs. Weldon, the latter, though she shared his distrust in a certain measure, could find no plausible motive for what would be criminal premeditation on the part of the head cook. However, as a matter of prudence, Negoro was well watched. Thereafter he attended to the novice's orders and he did not risk coming aft in the ship, where his duties never called him. Besides, Dingo having been installed there permanently, the cook took earn to keep away. During all that week the tempest did not abate.",test,0,1,0,head cook intend interest putting second compass service also could interest explanation desire desired land coast soon possible spoke incident latter though shared distrust certain measure could find plausible motive would criminal premeditation part head cook matter prudence well watched attended novices orders risk coming aft ship duties never called installed permanently cook took earn keep away week tempest abate
4793,"The barometer fell again. From the 14th to the 26th of March it was impossible to profit by a single calm to set a few sails. The ""Pilgrim"" scudded to the northeast with a speed which could not be less than two hundred miles in twenty-four hours, and still the land did not appear! --that land, America, which is thrown like an immense barrier between the Atlantic and the Pacific, over an extent of more than a hundred and twenty degrees! Dick Sand asked himself if he was not a fool, if he was still in his right mind, if, for so many days, unknown to him, he was not sailing in a false direction. No, he could not find fault with himself on that point. The sun, even though he could not perceive it in the fogs, always rose before him to set behind him. But, then, that land, had it disappeared? That America, on which his vessel would go to pieces, perhaps, where was it, if it was not there? Be it the Southern Continent or the Northern Continent--for anything way possible in that chaos--the ""Pilgrim"" could not miss either one or the other.",test,0,2,0,barometer fell impossible profit single calm set sails scudded northeast speed could less two hundred miles twentyfour hours still land appear land thrown like immense barrier extent hundred twenty degrees asked fool still right mind many days unknown sailing false direction could find fault point sun even though could perceive fogs always rose set behind land disappeared vessel would go pieces perhaps anything way possible chaosthe could miss either one
4794,"What had happened since the beginning of this frightful tempest? What was still going on, as that coast, whether it should prove salvation or destruction, did not appear? Must Dick Sand suppose, then, that he was deceived by his compass, whose indications he could no longer control, because the second compass was lacking to make that control? Truly, he had that fear which the absence of all land might justify. So, when he was at the helm, Dick Sand did not cease to devour the chart with his eyes. But he interrogated it in vain; it could not give him the solution of an enigma which, in the situation in which Negoro had placed him, was incomprehensible for him, as it would have been for any one else. On this day, however, the 26th of March, towards eight o'clock in the morning, an incident of the greatest importance took place. Hercules, on watch forward, gave this cry:  ""Land! land""! Dick Sand sprang to the forecastle.",test,0,1,0,happened since beginning frightful tempest still going coast whether prove salvation destruction appear suppose deceived compass whose indications could longer control second compass lacking make control fear absence land might justify helm cease devour chart eyes interrogated vain could give solution enigma situation placed incomprehensible would one else day however towards eight oclock morning incident greatest importance took place watch forward gave cry land sprang forecastle
4795,"Hercules could not have eyes like a seaman. Was he not mistaken? ""Land""? cried Dick Sand. ""There,"" replied Hercules, showing an almost imperceptible point on the horizon in the northeast. They hardly heard each other speak in the midst of the roaring of the sea and the sky. ""You have seen the land""? said the novice. ""Yes,"" replied Hercules. And his hand was still stretched out to larboard forward.",test,0,4,0,could eyes like seaman mistaken cried replied showing almost imperceptible point horizon northeast hardly heard speak midst roaring sea sky seen land said novice replied hand still stretched larboard forward
4796,"The novice looked. He saw nothing. At that moment, Mrs. Weldon, who had heard the cry given by Hercules, came up on deck, notwithstanding her promise not to come there. ""Madam""! cried Dick Sand. Mrs. Weldon, unable to make herself heard, tried, for herself, to perceive that land signaled by the black, and she seemed to have concentrated all her life in her eyes. It must be believed that Hercules's hand indicated badly the point of the horizon which he wished to show: neither Mrs. Weldon nor the novice could see anything. But, suddenly, Dick Sand in turn stretched out his hand. ""Yes! yes!",test,0,4,2,novice looked saw nothing moment heard cry given came deck notwithstanding promise come cried unable make heard tried perceive land signaled black seemed concentrated life eyes must believed hand indicated badly point horizon wished show neither novice could see anything suddenly turn stretched hand yes

Mrs. Weldon, sustained by Hercules, continued to watch that land almost despaired of. The coast, formed by that high summit, rose at a distance of ten miles to leeward. The opening being completely made in a breaking of the clouds, they saw it again more distinctly.",test,0,4,0,land said kind summit appeared opening fog sailors eyes could deceive last cried last clang feverishly netting sustained continued watch land almost despaired coast formed high summit rose distance ten miles leeward opening completely made breaking clouds saw distinctly
4798,"Doubtless it was some promontory of the American continent. The ""Pilgrim,"" without sails, was not in a condition to head toward it, but it could not fail to make the land there. That could be only a question of a few hours. Now, it was eight o'clock in the morning. Then, very certainly, before noon the ""Pilgrim"" would be near the land. At a sign from Dick Sand, Hercules led Mrs. Weldon aft again, for she could not bear up against the violence of the pitching. The novice remained forward for another instant, then he returned to the helm, near old Tom. At last, then, he saw that coast, so slowly made, so ardently desired! but it was now with a feeling of terror. In fact, in the ""Pilgrim's"" present condition, that is to say, scudding before the tempest, land to leeward, was shipwreck with all its terrible contingencies.",test,0,1,0,promontory continent without sails condition head toward could fail make land could question hours eight oclock morning certainly noon would near land sign led aft could bear violence pitching novice remained forward another instant returned helm near old last saw coast slowly made ardently desired feeling terror fact present condition say scudding tempest land leeward shipwreck terrible contingencies
4799,"Two hours passed away. The promontory was then seen off from the ship. At that moment they saw Negoro come on deck. This time he regarded the coast with extreme attention, shook his head like a man who would know what to believe, and went down again, after pronouncing a name that nobody could hear. Dick Sand himself sought to perceive the coast, which ought to round off behind the promontory. Two hours rolled by. The promontory was standing on the larboard stern, but the coast was not yet to be traced. Meanwhile the sky cleared at the horizon, and a high coast, like the American land, bordered by the immense chain of the Andes, should be visible for more than twenty miles.

4800,"He could see nothing! At two o'clock in the afternoon every trace of land had disappeared behind the ""Pilgrim"". Forward, the telescope could not seize any outline whatsoever of a coast, high or low. Then a cry escaped Dick Sand. Immediately leaving the deck, he rushed into the cabin, where Mrs. Weldon was with little Jack, Nan, and Cousin Benedict. ""An island! That was only an island""! said he.

4801,"asked Mrs. Weldon. ""The chart will tell us,"" replied the novice. And running to his berth, he brought the ship's chart. ""There, Mrs. Weldon, there""! said he. ""That land which we have seen, it can only be this point, lost in the middle of the Pacific! It can only be the Isle of Paques; there is no other in these parts"". ""And we have already left it behind""? asked Mrs. Weldon. ""Yes, well to the windward of us"".",test,0,4,0,asked chart tell us replied novice running berth brought ships chart said land seen point lost middle parts already left behind asked well windward us
4802,"Mrs. Weldon looked attentively at the Isle of Paques, which only formed an imperceptible point on the chart. ""And at what distance is it from the American coast""? ""Thirty-five degrees"". ""Which makes----""  ""About two thousand miles"". ""But then the 'Pilgrim' has not sailed, if we are still so far from the continent""? ""Mrs. Weldon,"" replied Dick Sand, who passed his hand over his forehead for a moment, as if to concentrate his ideas, ""I do not know--I cannot explain this incredible delay! No! I cannot--unless the indications of the compass have been false? But that island can only be the Isle of Paques, because we have been obliged to scud before the wind to the northeast, and we must thank Heaven, which has permitted me to mark our position!

4803,"I know, at last, where the tempest has blown us, and, if it abates, we shall be able to land on the American continent with some chance of safety. Now, at least, our ship is no longer lost on the immensity of the Pacific""! This confidence, shown by the young novice, was shared by all those who heard him speak. Mrs. Weldon, herself, gave way to it. It seemed, indeed, that these poor people were at the end of their troubles, and that the ""Pilgrim,"" being to the windward of her port, had only to wait for the open sea to enter it! The Isle of Paques--by its true name Vai-Hon--discovered by David in 1686, visited by Cook and Laperouse, is situated 27° south latitude and 112° east longitude. If the schooner had been thus led more than fifteen degrees to the north, that was evidently due to that tempest from the southwest, before which it had been obliged to scud. Then the ""Pilgrim"" was still two thousand miles from the coast. However, under the impetus of that wind which blew like thunder, it must, in less than ten days, reach some point of the coast of South America. But could they not hope, as the novice had said, that the weather would become more manageable, and that it would be possible to set some sail, when they should make the land?",test,0,2,0,know last tempest blown us abates shall able land continent chance safety least ship longer lost immensity confidence shown young novice shared heard speak gave way seemed indeed poor people end troubles windward port wait open sea enter true name visited situated south latitude east longitude schooner thus led fifteen degrees north evidently due tempest southwest obliged scud still two thousand miles coast impetus wind blew like thunder must less ten days reach point coast could hope novice said weather would become manageable would possible set sail make land
4804,"It was still Dick Sand's hope. He said to himself that this hurricane, which had lasted so many days, would end perhaps by ""killing itself"". And now that, thanks to the appearance of the Isle of Paques, he knew exactly his position, he had reason to believe that, once master of his vessel again, he would know how to lead her to a safe place. Yes! to have had knowledge of that isolated point in the middle of the sea, as by a providential favor, that had restored confidence to Dick Sand; if he was going all the time at the caprice of a hurricane, which he could not subdue, at least, he was no longer going quite blindfold. Besides, the ""Pilgrim,"" well-built and rigged, had suffered little during those rude attacks of the tempest. Her damages reduced themselves to the loss of the top-sail and the foretop-mast stay-sail--a loss which it would be easy to repair. Not a drop of water had penetrated through the well-stanched seams of the hull and the deck. The pumps were perfectly free. In this respect there was nothing to fear.",test,0,2,0,still hope said hurricane lasted many days would end perhaps thanks appearance knew exactly position reason believe master vessel would know lead safe place knowledge isolated point middle sea providential favor restored confidence going time caprice hurricane could subdue least longer going quite blindfold wellbuilt rigged suffered little rude attacks tempest damages reduced loss topsail foretopmast staysaila loss would easy repair drop water penetrated wellstanched seams hull deck pumps perfectly free respect nothing fear
4805,"There was, then, this interminable hurricane, whose fury nothing seemed able to moderate. If, in a certain measure, Dick Sand could put his ship in a condition to struggle against the violent storm, he could not order that wind to moderate, those waves to be still, that sky to become serene again. On board, if he was ""master after God,"" outside the ship, God alone commanded the winds and the waves. *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER XIII. LAND! LAND! Meanwhile, that confidence with which Dick Sand's heart filled instinctively, was going to be partly justified. The next day, March 27th, the column of mercury rose in the barometrical tube. The oscillation was neither sudden nor considerable--a few lines only--but the progression seemed likely to continue. The tempest was evidently going to enter its decreasing period, and, if the sea did remain excessively rough, they could tell that the wind was going down, veering slightly to the west.",test,0,1,0,interminable hurricane whose fury nothing seemed able moderate certain measure could put ship condition struggle violent storm could order wind moderate waves still sky become serene board outside ship alone commanded winds waves confidence heart filled instinctively going partly justified next day column mercury rose barometrical tube oscillation neither sudden considerablea lines onlybut progression seemed likely continue tempest evidently going enter decreasing period sea remain excessively rough could tell wind going veering slightly west
4806,"Dick Sand could not yet think of using any sail. The smallest sail would be carried away. However, he hoped that twenty-four hours would not elapse before it would be possible for him to rig a storm-jib. During the night, in fact, the wind went down quite noticeably, if they compared it to what it had been till then, and the ship was less tossed by those violent rollings which had threatened to break her in pieces. The passengers began to appear on deck again. They no longer ran the risk of being carried away by some surge from the sea. Mrs. Weldon was the first to leave the hatchway where Dick Sand, from prudent motives, had obliged them to shut themselves up during the whole duration of that long tempest. She came to talk with the novice, whom a truly superhuman will had rendered capable of resisting so much fatigue. Thin, pale under his sunburnt complexion, he might well be weakened by the loss of that sleep so necessary at his age.

4807,"Perhaps he would pay dearly some day for that period of trial. But that was not the moment to allow himself to be cast down. Dick Sand had said all that to himself. Mrs. Weldon found him as energetic as he had ever been. And then he had confidence, that brave Sand, and if confidence does not command itself, at least it commands. ""Dick, my dear child, my captain,"" said Mrs. Weldon, holding out her hand to the young novice. ""Ah! Mrs. Weldon,"" exclaimed Dick Sand, smiling, ""you disobey your captain. You return on deck, you leave your cabin in spite of his--prayers"".

""Dick,"" returned Mrs. Weldon, ""my husband and I, we shall never forget what you have just done"". ""God has done all,"" replied Dick Sand; ""all""!

4810,"As to Dick Sand's feelings, what pen could do them justice? He asked himself if he could not do more than give his life for his benefactors, and he accepted in advance all the trials which might come upon him in the future. After this conversation Dick Sand felt stronger. If the wind should become so moderate that he should be able to hoist some canvas, he did not doubt being able to steer his ship to a port where all those which it carried would at last be in safety. On the 29th, the wind having moderated a little, Dick Sand thought of setting the foresail and the top-sail, consequently to increase the speed of the ""Pilgrim"" while directing her course. ""Come, Tom; come, my friends""! cried he, when he went on deck at daybreak; ""come, I need your arms""! ""We are ready, Captain Sand,"" replied old Tom. ""Ready for everything,"" added Hercules.

""When there is a calm we shall make Hercules blow on the sails"". ""At your service, Mister Dick""! replied the brave black, inflating his cheeks like a gigantic Boreas. ""Now, my friends,"" continued the novice, we are to begin by binding a spare sail to the yard, because our top-sail was carried away in the hurricane.

If little Jack was proud of being assistant helmsman on the ""Pilgrim,"" it is superfluous to say so. ""Now to work,"" continued Dick Sand, ""and we must expose ourselves as little as possible"". The blacks, guided by the novice, went to work at once. To fasten a top-sail to its yard presented some difficulties for Tom and his companions. First the rolled up sail must be hoisted, then fastened to the yard. However, Dick Sand commanded so well, and was so well obeyed, that after an hour's work the sail was fastened to its yard, the yard hoisted, and the top-sail properly set with two reefs. As to the foresail and the second jib, which had been furled before the tempest, those sails were set without a great deal of trouble, in spite of the force of the wind.",test,0,2,0,asked little always ready work replied novice take place wheel friend help steer little proud assistant helmsman superfluous say work continued must expose little possible blacks guided novice went work fasten topsail yard presented difficulties companions rolled sail must hoisted fastened yard commanded well well obeyed hours work sail fastened yard yard hoisted topsail properly set two reefs foresail second jib furled tempest sails set without great deal trouble spite force wind
4813,"At last, on that day, at ten o'clock in the morning, the ""Pilgrim"" was sailing under her foresail, her top-sail, and her jib. Dick Sand had not judged it prudent to set more sail. The canvas which he carried ought to assure him, as long as the wind did not moderate, a speed of at least two hundred miles in twenty-four hours, and he did not need any greater to reach the American coast before ten days. The novice was indeed satisfied when, returning to the wheel, he again took his post, after thanking Master Jack, assistant helmsman of the ""Pilgrim"". He was no longer at the mercy of the waves. He was making headway. His joy will be understood by all those who are somewhat familiar with the things of the sea. The next day the clouds still ran with the same velocity, but they left large openings between them, through which the rays of the sun made their way to the surface of the waters.

4814,"Sometimes it was extinguished behind a large mass of vapors which came up in the east, then it reappeared, to disappear again, but the weather was becoming fine again. The scuttles had been opened to ventilate the interior of the ship. A salubrious air penetrated the hold, the rear hatchway, the crew's quarters. They put the wet sails to dry, stretching them out in the sun. The deck was also cleaned. Dick Sand did not wish his ship to arrive in port without having made a bit of toilet. Without overworking the crew, a few hours spent each day at that work would bring it to a good end. Though the novice could no longer throw the log, he was so accustomed to estimating the headway of a ship that he could take a close account of her speed. He had then no doubt of reaching land before seven days, and he gave that opinion to Mrs. Weldon, after showing her, on the chart, the probable position of the ship.

4815,"she asked him. ""Here, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied the novice, indicating that long coast line which extends from Peru to Chili. ""I do not know how to be more exact. Here is the Isle of Paques, that we have left behind in the west, and, by the direction of the wind, which has been constant, I conclude that we shall reach land in the east. Ports are quite numerous on that coast, but to name the one we shall have in view when we make the land is impossible at this moment"". ""Well, Dick, whichever it may be, that port will be welcome"". ""Yes, Mrs. Weldon, and you will certainly find there the means to return promptly to San Francisco. The Pacific Navigation Company has a very well organized service on this coast.

If we can procure an officer and a crew, we are going to discharge our cargo at Valparaiso, as Captain Hull would have done. Then we shall return to our own port. But that would delay you too much, and, though very sorry to be separated from you----""  ""Well, Dick,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, ""we shall see later what must be done. Tell me, you seem to fear the dangers which the land presents"". ""In fact, they are to be feared,"" replied the novice, ""but I am always hoping to meet some ship in these parts, and I am even very much surprised at not seeing any.

4817,"""There ought to be,"" replied Dick Sand, ""but much nearer land. We must then continue to approach it"". ""And if we do not meet a pilot""? asked Mrs. Weldon, who kept on questioning him in order to know how the young novice would prepare for all contingencies. ""In that case, Mrs. Weldon, either the weather will be clear, the wind moderate, and I shall endeavor to sail up the coast sufficiently near to find a refuge, or the wind will be stronger, and then----""  ""Then what will you do, Dick""? ""Then, in the present condition of the 'Pilgrim,'"" replied Dick Sand, ""once near the land, it will be very difficult to set off again"". ""What will you do""? repeated Mrs. Weldon. ""I shall be forced to run my ship aground,"" replied the novice, whose brow darkened for a moment.

4818,"it is a hard extremity. God grant that we may not be reduced to that. But, I repeat it, Mrs. Weldon, the appearance of the sky is reassuring, and it is impossible for a vessel or a pilot-boat not to meet us. Then, good hope. We are headed for the land, we shall see it before long"". Yes, to run a ship aground is a last extremity, to which the most energetic sailor does not resort without fear! Thus, Dick Sand did not wish to foresee it, while he had some chances of escaping it. For several days there were, in the state of the atmosphere, alternatives which, anew, made the novice very uneasy. The wind kept in the condition of a stiff breeze all the time, and certain oscillations of the barometrical column indicated that it tended to freshen. Dick Sand then asked himself, not without apprehension, if he would be again forced to scud without sails.",test,0,2,0,hard extremity grant may reduced repeat appearance sky reassuring impossible vessel pilotboat meet us good hope headed land shall see long run ship aground last extremity energetic sailor resort without fear wish foresee chances escaping several days state atmosphere alternatives anew made novice uneasy wind kept condition stiff breeze time certain oscillations barometrical column indicated tended freshen asked without apprehension would forced scud without sails
4819,"He had so much interest in keeping at least his top-sail, that he resolved to do so so long as it was not likely to be carried away. But, to secure the solidity of the masts, he had the shrouds and backstays hauled taut. Above all, all unnecessary risk must be avoided, as the situation would become one of the gravest, if the ""Pilgrim"" should be disabled by losing her masts. Once or twice, also, the barometer rising gave reason to fear that the wind might change point for point; that is to say, that it might pass to the east. It would then be necessary to sail close to the wind! A new anxiety for Dick Sand. What should he do with a contrary wind? Tack about? But if he was obliged to come to that, what new delays and what risks of being thrown into the offing. Happily those fears were not realized.",test,0,1,0,much interest keeping least topsail resolved long likely carried away secure solidity masts shrouds backstays hauled taut unnecessary risk must avoided situation would become one gravest disabled losing masts twice also barometer rising gave reason fear wind might change point point say might pass east would necessary sail close wind new anxiety contrary wind obliged come new delays risks thrown offing fears realized
4820,"The wind, after shifting for several days, blowing sometimes from the north, sometimes from the south, settled definitely in the west. But it was always a strong breeze, almost a gale, which strained the masting. It was the 5th of April. So, then, more than two months had already elapsed since the ""Pilgrim"" had left New Zealand. For twenty days a contrary wind and long calms had retarded her course. Then she was in a favorable condition to reach land rapidly. Her speed must even have been very considerable during the tempest. Dick Sand estimated its average at not less than two hundred miles a day! How, then, had he not yet made the coast?

4821,"It was absolutely inexplicable. And, nevertheless, no land was signaled, though one of the blacks kept watch constantly in the crossbars. Dick Sand often ascended there himself. There, with a telescope to his eyes, he sought to discover some appearance of mountains. The Andes chain is very high. It was there in the zone of the clouds that he must seek some peak, emerging from the vapors of the horizon. Several times Tom and his companions were deceived by false indications of land. They were only vapors of an odd form, which rose in the background. It happened sometimes that these honest men were obstinate in their belief; but, after a certain time, they were forced to acknowledge that they had been dupes of an optical illusion.

4822,"On the 6th of April there was no longer any doubt possible. It was eight o'clock in the morning. Dick Sand had just ascended into the bars. At that moment the fogs were condensed under the first rays of the sun, and the horizon was pretty clearly defined. From Dick Sand's lips escaped at last the so long expected cry:  ""Land! land before us""! At that cry every one ran on deck, little Jack, curious as folks are at that age, Mrs. Weldon, whose trials were going to cease with the landing, Tom and his companions, who were at last going to set foot again on the American continent, Cousin Benedict himself, who had great hope of picking up quite a rich collection of new insects for himself. Negoro, alone, did not appear. Each then saw what Dick Sand had seen, some very distinctly, others with the eyes of faith.

4823,"At a distance of about four miles to the east stretched a rather low coast, or at least what appeared such. It must be commanded behind by the high chain of the Andes, but the last zone of clouds did not allow the summits to be perceived. The ""Pilgrim"" sailed directly and rapidly to this coast, which grew larger to the eye. Two hours after it was only three miles away. This part of the coast ended in the northeast by a pretty high cape, which covered a sort of roadstead protected from land winds. On the contrary, in the southeast, it lengthened out like a thin peninsula. A few trees crowned a succession of low cliffs, which were then clearly defined under the sky. But it was evident, the geographical character of the country being given, that the high mountain chain of the Andes formed their background. Moreover, no habitation in sight, no port, no river mouth, which might serve as a harbor for a vessel.

4824,"With the reduced sail which she carried, the winds driving her to the coast, Dick Sand would not be able to set off from it. In front lay a long band of reefs, on which the sea was foaming all white. They saw the waves unfurl half way up the cliffs. There must be a monstrous surf there. Dick Sand, after remaining on the forecastle to observe the coast, returned aft, and, without saying a word, he took the helm. The wind was freshening all the time. The schooner was soon only a mile from the shore. Dick Sand then perceived a sort of little cove, into which he resolved to steer; but, before reaching it, he must cross a line of reefs, among which it would be difficult to follow a channel. The surf indicated that the water was shallow everywhere. At that moment Dingo, who was going backwards and forwards on the deck, dashed forward, and, looking at the land, gave some lamentable barks.",test,0,2,0,reduced sail carried winds driving coast would able set front lay long band reefs sea foaming white saw waves unfurl half way cliffs must monstrous surf remaining forecastle observe coast returned aft without saying word took helm wind freshening time schooner soon mile shore perceived sort little cove resolved steer reaching must cross line reefs among would difficult follow channel surf indicated water shallow everywhere moment going backwards forwards deck dashed forward looking land gave lamentable barks
4825,"One would say that the dog recognized the coast, and that its instinct recalled some sad remembrance. Negoro must have heard it, for an irresistible sentiment led him out of his cabin; and although he had reason to fear the dog, he came almost immediately to lean on the netting. Very fortunately for him Dingo, whose sad barks were all the time being addressed to that land, did not perceive him. Negoro looked at that furious surf, and that did not appear to frighten him. Mrs. Weldon, who was looking at him, thought she saw his face redden a little, and that for an instant his features were contracted. Then, did Negoro know this point of the continent where the winds were driving the ""Pilgrim""? At that moment Dick Sand left the wheel, which he gave back to old Tom. For a last time he came to look at the cove, which gradually opened. Then:  ""Mrs. Weldon,"" said he, in a firm voice, ""I have no longer any hope of finding a harbor!

""You have done all that depended on you, Dick""? asked Mrs. Weldon. ""All,"" replied the young novice. And at once he made his preparations for stranding the ship. First of all, Mrs. Weldon, Jack, Cousin Benedict and Nan, must put on life-preservers.

4827,"Hercules would take charge of Mrs. Weldon. The novice took little Jack under his care. Cousin Benedict, very tranquil, however, reappeared on the deck with his entomologist box strapped to his shoulder. The novice commended him to Bat and Austin. As to Negoro, his singular calmness said plainly enough that he had no need of anybody's aid. Dick Sand, by a supreme precaution, had also brought on the forecastle ten barrels of the cargo containing whale's oil. That oil, properly poured the moment the ""Pilgrim"" would be in the surf, ought to calm the sea for an instant, in lubricating, so to say, the molecules of water, and that operation would perhaps facilitate the ship's passage between the reefs. Dick Sand did not wish to neglect anything which might secure the common safety. All these precautions taken, the novice returned to take his place at the wheel. The ""Pilgrim"" was only two cables' lengths from the coast, that is, almost touching the reefs, her starboard side already bathed in the white foam of the surf.",test,0,2,0,would take charge novice took little care tranquil however reappeared deck entomologist box strapped shoulder novice commended singular calmness said plainly enough need anybodys aid supreme precaution also brought forecastle ten barrels cargo containing whales oil oil properly poured moment would surf ought calm sea instant lubricating say molecules water operation would perhaps facilitate ships passage reefs wish neglect anything might secure common safety precautions taken novice returned take place wheel two cables lengths coast almost touching reefs starboard side already bathed white foam surf
4828,"Each moment the novice thought that the vessel's keel was going to strike some rocky bottom. Suddenly, Dick Sand knew, by a change in the color of the water, that a channel lengthened out among the reefs. He must enter it bravely without hesitating, so as to make the coast as near as possible to the shore. The novice did not hesitate. A movement of the helm thrust the ship into the narrow and sinuous channel. In this place the sea was still more furious, and the waves dashed on the deck. The blacks were posted forward, near the barrels, waiting for the novice's orders. ""Pour the oil--pour""! exclaimed Dick Sand. Under this oil, which was poured on it in quantities, the sea grew calm, as by enchantment, only to become more terrible again a moment after.",test,0,1,0,moment novice thought vessels keel going strike rocky bottom knew change color water channel lengthened among reefs must enter bravely without hesitating make coast near possible shore novice hesitate movement helm thrust ship narrow sinuous channel place sea still furious waves dashed deck blacks posted forward near barrels waiting novices orders oilpour exclaimed oil poured quantities sea grew calm enchantment become terrible moment
4829,"The ""Pilgrim"" glided rapidly over those lubricated waters and headed straight for the shore. Suddenly a shock took place. The ship, lifted by a formidable wave, had just stranded, and her masting had fallen without wounding anybody. The ""Pilgrim's"" hull, damaged by the collision, was invaded by the water with extreme violence. But the shore was only half a cable's length off, and a chain of small blackish rocks enabled it to be reached quite easily. So, ten minutes after, all those carried by the ""Pilgrim"" had landed at the foot of the cliff. CHAPTER XIV. THE BEST TO DO. So then, after a voyage long delayed by calms, then favored by winds from the northwest and from the southwest--a voyage which had not lasted less than seventy-four days--the ""Pilgrim"" had just run aground!

4830,"and her companions thanked Providence, because they were in safety. In fact, it was on a continent, and not on one of the fatal isles of Polynesia, that the tempest had thrown them. Their return to their country, from any point of South America on which they should land, ought not, it seemed, to present serious difficulties. As to the ""Pilgrim,"" she was lost. She was only a carcass without value, of which the surf was going to disperse the _débris_ in a few hours. It would be impossible to save anything. But if Dick Sand had not that joy of bringing back a vessel intact to his ship-owner, at least, thanks to him, those who sailed in her were safe and sound on some hospitable coast, and among them, the wife and child of James W. Weldon. As to the question of knowing on what part of the American coast the schooner had been wrecked, they might dispute it for a long time. Was it, as Dick Sand must suppose, on the shore of Peru? Perhaps, for he knew, even by the bearings of the Isle of Paques, that the ""Pilgrim"" had been thrown to the northeast under the action of the winds; and also, without doubt, under the influence of the currents of the equatorial zone.",test,0,2,0,companions thanked safety fact continent one fatal isles tempest thrown return country point land ought seemed present serious difficulties lost carcass without value surf going disperse hours would impossible save anything joy bringing back vessel intact shipowner least thanks sailed safe sound hospitable coast among wife child question knowing part coast schooner wrecked might dispute long time must suppose shore knew even bearings thrown northeast action winds also without doubt influence currents equatorial zone
4831,"From the forty-third degree of latitude, it had, indeed, been possible to drift to the fifteenth. It was then important to determine, as soon as possible, the precise point of the coast where the schooner had just been lost. Granted that this coast was that of Peru, ports, towns and villages were not lacking, and consequently it would be easy to gain some inhabited place. As to this part of the coast, it seemed deserted. It was a narrow beach, strewed with black rocks, shut off by a cliff of medium height, very irregularly cut up by large funnels due to the rupture of the rock. Here and there a few gentle declivities gave access to its crest. In the north, at a quarter of a mile from the stranding place, was the mouth of a little river, which could not have been perceived from the offing. On its banks hung numerous _rhizomas_, sorts of mangroves, essentially distinct from their congeners of India. The crest of the cliff--that was soon discovered--was overhung by a thick forest, whose verdant masses undulated before the eyes, and extended as far as the mountains in the background. There, if Cousin Benedict had been a botanist, how many trees, new to him, would not have failed to provoke his admiration.",test,0,2,0,fortythird degree latitude indeed possible drift fifteenth important determine soon possible precise point coast schooner lost coast ports towns villages lacking consequently would easy gain inhabited place part coast seemed deserted narrow beach strewed black rocks shut cliff medium height irregularly cut large funnels due rupture rock gentle declivities gave access crest north quarter mile stranding place mouth little river could perceived offing banks hung numerous sorts mangroves essentially distinct congeners crest cliffthat soon discoveredwas overhung thick forest whose verdant masses undulated eyes extended far mountains background botanist many trees new would failed provoke admiration
4832,"There were high baobabs--to which, however, an extraordinary longevity has been falsely attributed--the bark of which resembles Egyptian syenite, Bourbon palms, white pines, tamarind-trees, pepper-plants of a peculiar species, and a hundred other plants that an American is not accustomed to see in the northern region of the New Continent. But, a circumstance rather curious, among those forest productions one would not meet a single specimen of that numerous family of palm-trees which counts more than a thousand species, spread in profusion over almost the whole surface of the globe. Above the sea-shore a great number of very noisy birds were flying, which belonged for the greater part to different varieties of swallows, of black plumage, with a steel-blue shade, but of a light chestnut color on the upper part of the head. Here and there also rose some partridges, with necks entirely white, and of a gray color. Mrs. Weldon and Dick Sand observed that these different birds did not appear to be at all wild. They approached without fearing anything. Then, had they not yet learned to fear the presence of man, and was this coast so deserted that the detonation of a firearm had never been heard there? At the edge of the rocks were walking some pelicans of the species of ""pelican minor,"" occupied in filling with little fish the sack which they carry between the branches of their lower jaw. Some gulls, coming from the offing, commenced to fly about around the ""Pilgrim"".

4833,"But, however little Jack would have it, one could not ask them the name of the country; in order to learn it, it would be necessary to address some native. There were none there, or at least, there was not one to be seen. No habitation, hut, or cabin, neither in the north, beyond the little river, nor in the south, nor finally on the upper part of the cliff, in the midst of the trees of the thick forest. No smoke ascended into the air, no indication, mark, or imprint indicated that this portion of the continent was visited by human beings. Dick Sand continued to be very much surprised.

The dog went backward and forward on the strand, his nose to the ground, his tail down, growling secretly--certainly very singular behavior--but neither betraying the approach of man nor of any animal whatsoever. ""Dick, look at Dingo""! said Mrs. Weldon. ""Yes, that is very strange,"" replied the novice. ""It seems as if he were trying to recover a scent"".

'""  In fact, Negoro surveyed the strand, turned back, and looked at the shore and the cliff like a man trying to recall recollections and to fix them. Did he, then, know this country? He would probably have refused to reply to that question if it had been asked. The best thing was still to have nothing to do with that very unsociable personage. Dick Sand soon saw him walk from the side of the little river, and when Negoro had disappeared on the other side of the cliff, he ceased to think of him.

4836,"Now, the most pressing was to find a refuge, a shelter of some kind, where they could install themselves for the time, and partake of some nourishment. Then they would take counsel, and they would decide what it would be convenient to do. As to food, they had not to trouble themselves. Without speaking of the resources which the country must offer, the ship's store-room had emptied itself for the benefit of the survivors of the shipwreck. The surf had thrown here and there among the rocks, then uncovered by the ebb-tide, a great quantity of objects. Tom and his companions had already picked up some barrels of biscuit, boxes of alimentary preserves, cases of dried meat. The water not having yet damaged them, food for the little troop was secured for more time, doubtless, than they would require to reach a town or a village. In that respect there was nothing to fear. These different waifs, already put in a safe place, could no longer be taken back by a rising sea.

4837,"First of all Dick Sand had taken care to send Hercules to the little river for a few pints. But it was a cask which the vigorous negro brought back on his shoulder, after having filled it with water fresh and pure, which the ebb of the tide left perfectly drinkable. As to a fire, if it were necessary to light one, dead wood was not lacking in the neighborhood, and the roots of the old mangroves ought to furnish all the fuel of which they would have need. Old Tom, an ardent smoker, was provided with a certain quantity of German tinder, well preserved in a box hermetically closed, and when they wanted it, he would only have to strike the tinder-box with the flint of the strand. It remained, then, to discover the hole in which the little troop would lie down, in case they must take one night's rest before setting out. And, indeed, it was little Jack who found the bedroom in question, While trotting about at the foot of the cliff, he discovered, behind a turn of the rock, one of those grottoes well polished, well hollowed out, which the sea herself digs, when the waves, enlarged by the tempest, beat the coast. The young child was delighted. He called his mother with cries of joy, and triumphantly showed her his discovery.

4838,"""If we were Robinson Crusoes, destined to live a long time on this shore, we should not forget to give your name to that grotto""! The grotto was only from ten to twelve feet long, and as many wide; but, in little Jack's eyes, it was an enormous cavern. At all events, it must suffice to contain the shipwrecked ones; and, as Mrs. Weldon and Nan noted with satisfaction, it was very dry. The moon being then in her first quarter, they need not fear that those neap-tides would reach the foot of the cliff, and the grotto in consequence. Then, nothing more was needed for a few hours' rest. Ten minutes after everybody was stretched out on a carpet of sea-weed. Negoro himself thought he must rejoin the little troop and take his part of the repast, which was going to be made in common. Doubtless he had not judged it proper to venture alone under the thick forest, through which the winding river made its way. It was one o'clock in the afternoon. The preserved meat, the biscuit, the sweet water, with the addition of a few drops of rum, of which Bat had saved a quarter cask, made the requisites for this repast.",test,0,2,0,destined live long time shore forget give name grotto grotto ten twelve feet long many wide little eyes enormous cavern events must suffice contain shipwrecked ones noted satisfaction dry moon first quarter need fear neaptides would reach foot cliff grotto consequence nothing needed hours rest minutes everybody stretched carpet seaweed thought must rejoin little troop take part repast going made common judged proper venture alone thick forest winding river made way one oclock afternoon preserved meat biscuit sweet water addition drops rum saved quarter cask made requisites repast
4839,"But if Negoro took part in it, he did not at all mingle in the conversation, in which were discussed the measures demanded by the situation of the shipwrecked. All the time, without appearing to do so, he listened to it, and doubtless profited by what he heard. During this time Dingo, who had not been forgotten, watched outside the grotto. They could be at ease. No living being would show himself on the strand without the faithful animal giving the alarm. Mrs. Weldon, holding her little Jack, half lying and almost asleep on her lap, began to speak. ""Dick, my friend,"" said she, ""in the name of all, I thank you for the devotion that you have shown us till now; but we do not consider you free yet.

4840,"What must we do""? Mrs. Weldon, old Nan, Tom and his companions, all had their eyes fixed on the young novice. Negoro himself looked at him with a singular persistence. Evidently, what Dick Sand was going to reply interested him very particularly. Dick Sand reflected for a few moments. Then:  ""Mrs. Weldon,"" said he, ""the important thing is to know, first, where we are. I believe that our ship can only have made the land on that portion of the American sea-coast which forms the Peruvian shore. The winds and currents must have carried her as far as that latitude.

""Well, what is to be done""? repeated Mrs. Weldon. ""My advice,"" replied Dick Sand, ""would be not to leave this shelter till we know our situation. To-morrow, after a night's rest, two of us could go to discover it. They would endeavor, without going too far, to meet some natives, to inform themselves from them, and return to the grotto.

4842,"""That seems necessary to me,"" replied the novice. ""If no information can be picked up, if, as is not impossible, the country is absolutely desolate, well, we shall consider some other way of extricating ourselves"". ""And which of us shall go to explore""? asked Mrs. Weldon, after a moment's reflection. ""That is yet to be decided,"" replied Dick Sand. ""At all events, I think that you, Mrs. Weldon, Jack, Mr. Benedict, and Nan, ought not to quit this grotto. Bat, Hercules, Acteon, and Austin should remain near you, while Tom and I should go forward. Negoro, doubtless, will prefer to remain here""? added Dick Sand, looking at the head-cook.

4843,"""We should take Dingo with us,"" continued the novice. ""He would be useful to us during our exploration"". Dingo, hearing his name pronounced, reappeared at the entrance of the grotto, and seemed to approve of Dick Sand's projects by a little bark. Since the novice had made this proposition, Mrs. Weldon remained pensive. Her repugnance to the idea of a separation, even short, was very serious. Might it not happen that the shipwreck of the ""Pilgrim"" would soon be known to the Indian tribes who frequented the sea-shore, either to the north or to the south, and in case some plunderers of the wrecks thrown on the shore should present themselves, was it not better for all to be united to repulse them? That objection, made to the novice's proposition, truly merited a discussion. It fell, however, before Dick Sand's arguments, who observed that the Indians ought not to be confounded with the savages of Africa or Polynesia, and any aggression on their part was probably not to be feared. But to entangle themselves in this country without even knowing to what province of South America it belonged, nor at what distance the nearest town of that province was situated, was to expose themselves to many fatigues. Doubtless separation might have its inconveniences, but far less than marching blindly into the midst of a forest which appeared to stretch as far as the base of the mountains.",test,0,2,0,take us continued novice would useful us exploration hearing name pronounced reappeared entrance grotto seemed approve projects little bark novice made proposition remained pensive repugnance idea separation even short serious happen shipwreck would soon known tribes frequented seashore either north south case plunderers wrecks thrown shore present better united repulse objection made novices proposition truly merited discussion fell however arguments observed ought confounded savages aggression part probably feared entangle country without even knowing province belonged distance nearest town province situated expose many fatigues separation might inconveniences far less marching blindly midst forest appeared stretch far base mountains
4844,"""Besides,"" repeated Dick Sand, persistently, ""I cannot admit that this separation will be of long duration, and I even affirm that it will not be so. After two days, at the most, if Tom and I have come across neither habitation nor inhabitant, we shall return to the grotto. But that is too improbable, and we shall not have advanced twenty miles into the interior of the country before we shall evidently be satisfied about its geographical situation. I may be mistaken in my calculation, after all, because the means of fixing it astronomically have failed me, and it is not impossible for us to be in a higher or lower latitude"". ""Yes--you are certainly right, my child,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, in great anxiety. ""And you, Mr. Benedict,"" asked Dick Sand, ""what do you think of this project""? ""I""? replied Cousin Benedict. ""Yes; what is your advice""?

Do you wish to remain here one day or two? that suits me, and I shall employ my time in studying this shore from a purely entomological point of view"". ""Do, then, according to your wish,"" said Mrs. Weldon to Dick Sand. ""We shall remain here, and you shall depart with old Tom"". ""That is agreed upon,"" said Cousin Benedict, in the most tranquil manner in the world. ""As for me, I am going to pay a visit to the insects of the country"".

4846,"""And above all, do not bring back too many musquitoes,"" added old Tom. A few moments after, the entomologist, his precious tin box strapped to his shoulders, left the grotto. Almost at the same time Negoro abandoned it also. It appeared quite natural to that man to, be always occupied with himself. But, while Cousin Benedict clambered up the slopes of the cliff to go to explore the border of the forest, he, turning round toward the river, went away with slow steps and disappeared, a second time ascending the steep bank. Jack slept all the time. Mrs. Weldon, leaving him on Nan's knees, then descended toward the strand. Dick Sand and his companions followed her. The question was, to see if the state of the sea then would permit them to go as far as the ""Pilgrim's"" hull, where there were still many objects which might be useful to the little troop.

4847,"In the midst of the _débris_ of all kinds stood the ship's carcass, which the high sea had partly covered again. That astonished Dick Sand, for he knew that the tides are only very moderate on the American sea-shore of the Pacific. But, after all, this phenomenon might be explained by the fury of the wind which beat the coast. On seeing their ship again, Mrs. Weldon and her companions experienced a painful impression. It was there that they had lived for long days, there that they had suffered. The aspect of that poor ship, half broken, having neither mast nor sails, lying on her side like a being deprived of life, sadly grieved their hearts. But they must visit this hull, before the sea should come to finish demolishing it. Dick Sand and the blacks could easily make their way into the interior, after having hoisted themselves on deck by means of the ropes which hung over the ""Pilgrim's"" side. While Tom, Hercules, Bat, and Austin employed themselves in taking from the storeroom all that might be useful, as much eatables as liquids, the novice made his way into the arsenal.

4848,"There Dick Sand found four guns in good condition, excellent Remingtons from Purdy & Co.'s factory, as well as a hundred cartridges, carefully shut up in their cartridge-boxes. There was material to arm his little band, and put it in a state of defense, if, contrary to all expectation, the Indians attacked him on the way. The novice did not neglect to take a pocket-lantern; but the ship's charts, laid in a forward quarter and damaged by the water, were beyond use. There were also in the ""Pilgrim's"" arsenal some of those solid cutlasses which serve to cut up whales. Dick Sand chose six, destined to complete the arming of his companions, and he did not forget to bring an inoffensive child's gun, which belonged to little Jack. As to the other objects still held by the ship, they had either been dispersed, or they could no longer be used. Besides, it was useless to overburden themselves for the few days the journey would last. In food, in arms, in munitions, they were more than provided for. Meanwhile, Dick Sand, by Mrs. Weldon's advice, did not neglect to take all the money which he found on board--about five hundred dollars.

4849,"Mrs. Weldon had carried a larger amount herself and she did not find it again. Who, then, except Negoro, had been able to visit the ship before them and to lay hands on Captain Hull's and Mrs. Weldon's reserve? No one but he, surely, could be suspected. However, Dick Sand hesitated a moment. All that he knew and all that he saw of him was that everything was to be feared from that concentrated nature, from whom the misfortunes of others could snatch a smile. Yes, Negoro was an evil being, but must they conclude from that that he was a criminal? It was painful to Dick Sand's character to go as far as that. And, meanwhile, could suspicion rest on any other? No, those honest negroes had not left the grotto for an instant, while Negoro had wandered over the beach. He alone must be guilty.",test,0,1,0,carried larger amount find except able visit ship lay hands reserve one surely could suspected hesitated moment knew saw everything feared concentrated nature misfortunes others could snatch smile evil must conclude criminal painful character go far meanwhile could suspicion rest honest negroes left grotto instant wandered beach alone must guilty
4850,"Dick Sand then resolved to question Negoro, and, if necessary, have him searched when he returned. He wished to know decidedly what to believe. The sun was then going down to the horizon. At that date he had not yet crossed the equator to carry heat and light into the northern hemisphere, but he was approaching it. He fell, then, almost perpendicularly to that circular line where the sea and the sky meet. Twilight was short, darkness fell promptly--which confirmed the novice in the thought that he had landed on a point of the coast situated between the tropic of Capricorn and the equator. Mrs. Weldon, Dick Sand, and the blacks then returned to the grotto, where they must take some hours' rest. ""The night will still be stormy,"" observed Tom, pointing to the horizon laden with heavy clouds. ""Yes,"" replied Dick Sand, ""there is a strong breeze blowing up. But what matter, at present?",test,0,1,0,resolved question necessary searched returned wished know decidedly believe sun going horizon date yet crossed equator carry heat light northern hemisphere approaching fell almost perpendicularly circular line sea sky meet short darkness fell promptlywhich confirmed novice thought landed point coast situated tropic equator blacks returned grotto must take hours rest night still stormy observed pointing horizon laden heavy clouds replied strong breeze blowing matter present
4851,"Our poor ship is lost, and the tempest can no longer reach us""? ""God's will be done""! said Mrs. Weldon. It was agreed that during that night, which would be very dark, each of the blacks would watch turn about at the entrance to the grotto. They could, besides, count upon Dingo to keep a careful watch. They then perceived that Cousin Benedict had not returned. Hercules called him with all the strength of his powerful lungs, and almost immediately they saw the entomologist coming down the slopes of the cliff, at the risk of breaking his neck. Cousin Benedict was literally furious. He had not found a single new insect in the forest--no, not one--which was fit to figure in his collection. Scorpions, scolopendras, and other myriapodes, as many as he could wish, and even more, were discovered.",test,0,1,0,poor ship lost tempest longer reach us done said agreed night would dark blacks would watch turn entrance grotto could besides count upon keep careful watch perceived returned called strength powerful lungs almost immediately saw entomologist coming slopes cliff risk breaking neck literally furious found single new insect forestno onewhich fit figure collection scolopendras myriapodes many could wish even discovered
4852,"And we know that Cousin Benedict did not interest himself in myriapodes. ""It was not worth the trouble,"" added he, ""to travel five or six thousand miles, to have braved the tempest, to be wrecked on the coast, and not meet one of those American hexapodes, which do honor to an entomological museum! No; the game was not worth the candle""! As a conclusion, Cousin Benedict asked to go away. He did not wish to remain another hour on that detested shore. Mrs. Weldon calmed her large child. They made him hope that he would be more fortunate the next day, and all went to lie down in the grotto, to sleep there till sunrise, when Tom observed that Negoro had not yet returned, though night had arrived.

4853,"said Bat. ""On the contrary, it does matter,"" replied Mrs. Weldon. ""I should prefer having that man still near us"". ""Doubtless, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied Dick Sand; ""but if he has forsaken our company voluntarily, I do not see how we could oblige him to rejoin us. Who knows but he has his reasons for avoiding us forever""? And taking Mrs. Weldon aside, Dick Sand confided to her his suspicions. He was not astonished to find that she had them also. Only they differed on one point. ""If Negoro reappears,"" said Mrs. Weldon, ""he will have put the product of his theft in a safe place. Take my advice.",test,0,1,1,said contrary matter replied prefer man still near us replied forsaken company voluntarily see could oblige rejoin us knows reasons avoiding us forever taking aside confided suspicions astonished find also differed one point reappears said put product theft safe place advice
4854,"What we had better do, not being able to convict him, will be to hide our suspicions from him, and let him believe that we are his dupes"". Mrs. Weldon was right. Dick Sand took her advice. However, Negoro was called several times. He did not reply. Either he was still too far away to hear, or he did not wish to return. The blacks did not regret being rid of his presence; but, as Mrs. Weldon had just said, perhaps he was still more to be feared afar than near. And, moreover, how explain that Negoro would venture alone into that unknown country? Had he then lost his way, and on this dark night was he vainly seeking the way to the grotto?

4855,"However it was, they could not, in order to wait for Negoro, deprive themselves of a repose so necessary to all. At that moment the dog, which was running on the strand, barked aloud. ""What is the matter with Dingo""? asked Mrs. Weldon. ""We must, indeed, find out,"" replied the novice. ""Perhaps it is Negoro coming back"". At once Hercules, Bat, Austin, and Dick Sand took their way to the mouth of the river. But, arrived at the bank, they neither saw nor heard anything. Dingo now was silent.

4856,"The going to sleep was organized as well as possible. Each of the blacks prepared himself to watch in turn outside. But Mrs. Weldon, uneasy, could not sleep. It seemed to her that this land so ardently desired did not give her what she had been led to hope for, security for hers, and rest for herself. *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER XV. HARRIS. The next day, April 7th, Austin, who was on guard at sunrise, saw Dingo run barking to the little river. Almost immediately Mrs. Weldon, Dick Sand and the blacks came out of the grotto. Decidedly there was something there.

4857,"""At all events it was not Negoro,"" observed Tom, ""for Dingo would bark with fury"". ""If it is not Negoro, where can he be""? asked Mrs. Weldon, giving Dick Sand a look which was only understood by him; ""and if it is not he, who, then, is it""? ""We are going to see, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied the novice. Then, addressing Bat, Austin, and Hercules, ""Arm yourselves, my friends, and come""! Each of the blacks took a gun and a cutlass, as Dick Sand had done. A cartridge was slipped into the breech of the Remingtons, and, thus armed, all four went to the bank of the river. Mrs. Weldon, Tom, and Acteon remained at the entrance of the grotto, where little Jack and Nan still rested by themselves. The sun was then rising. His rays, intercepted by the high mountains in the east, did not reach the cliff directly; but as far as the western horizon, the sea sparkled under the first fires of day.",test,0,2,0,events observed would bark fury asked giving look understood going see replied novice addressing friends come blacks took gun cutlass done cartridge slipped breech thus armed four went bank river remained entrance grotto little still rested sun rising rays intercepted high mountains east reach cliff directly far western horizon sea sparkled first fires day
4858,"Dick Sand and his companions followed the strand of the shore, the curve of which joined the mouth of the river. There Dingo, motionless, and as if on guard, was continually barking. It was evident that he saw or scented some native. And, in fact, it was no longer against Negoro, against its enemy on board the ship, that the dog had a grudge this time. At that moment a man turned the last plane of the cliff. He advanced prudently to the strand, and, by his familiar gestures, he sought to calm Dingo. They saw that he did not care to face the anger of the vigorous animal. ""It is not Negoro""! said Hercules. ""We cannot lose by the change,"" replied Bat.",test,0,1,0,companions followed strand shore curve joined mouth river motionless guard continually barking evident saw scented native fact longer enemy board ship dog grudge time moment man turned last plane cliff advanced prudently strand familiar gestures sought calm saw care face anger vigorous animal said lose change replied
4859,"""No,"" said the novice. ""It is probably some native, who will spare us the _ennui_ of a separation. We are at last going to know exactly where we are"". And all four, putting their guns back on their shoulders, went rapidly toward the unknown. The latter, on seeing them approach, at first gave signs of the greatest surprise. Very certainly, he did not expect to meet strangers on that part of the coast. Evidently, also, he had not yet perceived the remains of the ""Pilgrim,"" otherwise the presence of the shipwrecked would very naturally be explained to him. Besides, during the night the surf had finished demolishing the ship's hull; there was nothing left but the wrecks that floated in the offing. At the first moment the unknown, seeing four armed men marching toward him, made a movement as if he would retrace his steps. He carried a gun in a shoulder-belt, which passed rapidly into his hand, and from his hand to his shoulder.",test,0,1,0,said novice probably native spare us separation last going know exactly four putting guns back shoulders went rapidly toward unknown latter seeing approach first gave signs greatest surprise certainly expect meet strangers part coast also yet perceived remains otherwise presence shipwrecked would naturally explained night surf finished demolishing ships hull nothing left wrecks floated offing first moment unknown seeing four armed men marching toward made movement would retrace steps carried gun shoulderbelt passed rapidly hand hand shoulder
4860,"They felt that he was not reassured. Dick Sand made a gesture of salutation, which doubtless the unknown understood, for, after some hesitation, he continued to advance. Dick Sand could then examine him with attention. He was a vigorous man, forty years old at the most, his eyes bright, his hair and beard gray, his skin sunburnt like that of a nomad who has always lived in the open air, in the forest, or on the plain. A kind of blouse of tanned skin served him for a close coat, a large hat covered his head, leather boots came up above his knees, and spurs with large rowels sounded from their high heels. What Dick Sand noticed at first--and which was so, in fact--was that he had before him, not one of those Indians, habitual rovers over the pampas, but one of those adventurers of foreign blood, often not very commendable, who are frequently met with in those distant countries. It also seemed, by his rather familiar attitude, by the reddish color of a few hairs of his beard, that this unknown must be of Anglo-Saxon origin. At all events, he was neither an Indian nor a Spaniard. And that appeared certain, when in answer to Dick Sand, who said to him in English, ""Welcome""! he replied in the same language and without any accent.",test,0,2,0,felt reassured made gesture salutation doubtless unknown understood hesitation continued advance could examine attention vigorous man forty years old eyes bright hair beard gray skin sunburnt like nomad always lived open air forest plain kind blouse tanned skin served close coat large hat covered head leather boots came knees spurs large rowels sounded high heels noticed firstand factwas one habitual rovers pampas one adventurers foreign blood often commendable frequently met distant countries also seemed rather familiar attitude reddish color hairs beard unknown must origin events neither appeared certain answer said replied language without accent
4861,"""Welcome yourself, my young friend,"" said the unknown, advancing toward the novice, whose hand he pressed. As to the blacks, he contented himself with making a gesture to them without speaking to them. ""You are English""? he asked the novice. ""Americans,"" replied Dick Sand. ""From the South""? ""From the North"". This reply seemed to please the unknown, who shook the novice's hand more vigorously and this time in very a American manner. ""And may I know, my young friend,"" he asked, ""how you find yourself on this coast""?

4862,"Mrs. Weldon had advanced as far as the steep bank, and she then found herself facing him. It was she who replied to this question. ""Sir,"" said she, ""we are shipwrecked ones whose ship was broken to pieces yesterday on these reefs"". An expression of pity spread over the unknown's face, whose eyes sought the vessel which had been stranded. ""There is nothing left of our ship,"" added the novice. ""The surf has finished the work of demolishing it during the night"". ""And our first question,"" continued Mrs. Weldon, ""will be to ask you where we are"". ""But you are on the sea-coast of South America,"" replied the unknown, who appeared surprised at the question. ""Can you have any doubt about that""?

4864,"""I cannot tell you the name,"" replied the unknown, ""for if I know the country in the interior pretty well from having often traversed it, it is my first visit to this shore"". Dick Sand reflected on what he had just learned. That only half astonished him, for his calculation might have, and indeed must have, deceived him, concerning the currents; but the error was not considerable. In fact, he believed himself somewhere between the twenty-seventh and the thirtieth parallel, from the bearings he had taken from the Isle of Paques, and it was on the twenty-fifth parallel that he was wrecked. There was no impossibility in the ""Pilgrim's"" having deviated by relatively small digression, in such a long passage. Besides, there was no reason to doubt the unknown's assertions, and, as that coast was that of lower Bolivia there was nothing astonishing in its being so deserted. ""Sir,"" then said Dick Sand, ""after your reply I must conclude that we are at a rather great distance from Lima"". ""Oh! Lima is far away--over there--in the north""! Mrs. Weldon, made suspicious first of all by Negoro's disappearance, observed the newly-arrived with extreme attention; but she could discover nothing, either in his attitude or in his manner of expressing himself which could lead her to suspect his good faith.",test,0,2,0,tell name replied unknown know country interior pretty well often traversed first visit shore reflected learned half astonished calculation might indeed must deceived concerning currents error considerable fact believed somewhere twentyseventh thirtieth parallel bearings taken twentyfifth parallel wrecked impossibility deviated relatively small digression long passage reason doubt unknowns assertions coast lower nothing astonishing deserted said reply must conclude rather great distance far awayover therein north made suspicious first disappearance observed newlyarrived extreme attention could discover nothing either attitude manner expressing could lead suspect good faith

""I am American as you are, madam,"" said the unknown, who waited for an instant for the American lady to tell him her name. ""Mrs. Weldon,"" replied the latter. ""I? My name is Harris and I was born in South Carolina. But here it is twenty years since I left my country for the pampas of Bolivia, and it gives me pleasure to see compatriots"".

""The desert of Atacama""? repeated Dick Sand. ""Yes,"" replied Harris. ""This desert is like a country by itself, in this vast South America, from which it differs in many respects.

4867,"""Oh, it is not the first time that I have taken this journey""! replied the American. ""There is, two hundred miles from here, an important farm, the Farm of San Felice, which belongs to one of my brothers, and it is to his house that I am going for my trade. If you wish to follow me you will be well received, and the means of transport to gain the town of Atacama will not fail you. My brother will be happy to furnish, them"". These offers, made freely, could only prepossess in favor of the American, who immediately continued, addressing Mrs. Weldon:  ""These blacks are your slaves""? And he pointed to Tom and his companions. ""We have no longer any slaves in the United States,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, quickly.

4868,"that is so,"" replied Harris. ""I had forgotten that the war of 1862 had decided that grave question. I ask those honest men's pardon for it,"" added Harris, with that delicate irony which a Southerner must put into his language when speaking to blacks. ""But on seeing those gentlemen in your service, I believed----""  ""They are not, and have never been, in my service, sir,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, gravely. ""We should be honored in serving you, Mrs. Weldon,"" then said old Tom. ""But, as Mr. Harris knows, we do not belong to anybody. I have been a slave myself, it is true, and sold as such in Africa, when I was only six years old; but my son Bat, here, was born of an enfranchised father, and, as to our companions, they were born of free parents"". ""I can only congratulate you about it,"" replied Harris, in a tone which Mrs. Weldon did not find sufficiently serious. ""In this land of Bolivia, also, we have no slaves.

""The charming little boy""! said the American, approaching Jack. ""It is my son,"" replied Mrs. Weldon. ""Oh, Mrs. Weldon, you must have been doubly tried, because your child has been exposed to so many dangers"".

4871,"But the offer of the gentle pony did not succeed in cajoling Jack any more than the proposition to embrace Mr. Harris. Mrs. Weldon, thus opposed, hastened to change the conversation. They must not offend a man who had so obligingly offered his services. During this time Dick Sand was reflecting on the proposition which had been made to them so opportunely, to gain the Farm of San Felice. It was, as Harris had said, a journey of over two hundred miles, sometimes through forests, sometimes through plains--a very fatiguing journey, certainly, because there were absolutely no means of transport. The young novice then presented some observations to that effect, and waited for the reply the American was going to make. ""The journey is a little long, indeed,"" replied Harris, ""but I have there, a few hundred feet behind the steep bank, a horse which I count on offering to Mrs. Weldon and her son. For us, there is nothing difficult, nor even very fatiguing in making the journey on foot. Besides, when I spoke of two hundred miles, it was by following, as I have already done, the course of this river.

4872,"Now, at the rate of ten miles a day, it seems to me that we shall arrive at the Farm without too much distress"". Mrs. Weldon thanked the American. ""You cannot thank me better than by accepting,"" replied Harris. ""Though I have never crossed this forest, I do not believe I shall be embarrassed in finding the way, being sufficiently accustomed to the pampas. But there is a graver question--that of food.

""Mr. Harris,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, ""fortunately we have food in more than sufficient quantity, and we shall be happy to share with you"". ""Well, Mrs. Weldon, it seems to me that all is arranged for the best, and that we have only to set out"". Harris went toward the steep bank, with the intention of going to take his horse from the place where he had left it, when Dick Sand stopped him again, by asking him a question. To abandon the sea-coast, to force his way into the interior of the country, under that interminable forest, did not please the young novice.",test,0,2,0,rate ten miles day seems shall arrive without much distress thanked thank better accepting replied never crossed forest believe shall embarrassed finding way sufficiently accustomed pampas graver questionthat food barely enough way replied food sufficient quantity shall happy share seems arranged best set went toward steep bank intention going take horse place left stopped asking question abandon seacoast force way interior country interminable forest please young novice
4873,"The sailor reappeared in him, and either to ascend or descend the coast would be more to his mind. ""Mr. Harris,"" said he, ""instead of traveling for one hundred and twenty miles in the Desert of Atacama, why not follow the coast? Distance for distance, would it not be better worth while to seek to reach the nearest town, either north or south""? ""But my young friend,"" replied Harris, frowning slightly, ""it seems to me that on this coast, which I know very imperfectly, there is no town nearer than three or four hundred miles"". ""To the north, yes,"" replied Dick Sand; ""but to the south----""  ""To the south,"" replied the American, ""we must descend as far as Chili. Now, the distance is almost as long, and, in your place, I should not like to pass near the pampas of the Argentine Republic. As to me, to my great regret, I could not accompany you there"". ""The ships which go from Chili to Peru, do they not pass, then, in sight of this coast""? asked Mrs. Weldon.

4874,"""They keep much more out at sea, and you ought not to meet any of them"". ""Truly,"" replied Mrs. Weldon. ""Well, Dick, have you still some question to ask Mr. Harris""? ""A single one, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied the novice, who experienced some difficulty in giving up. ""I shall ask Mr. Harris in what port he thinks we shall be able to find a ship to bring us back to San Francisco""? ""Faith, my young friend, I could not tell you,"" replied the American. ""All that I know is, that at the Farm of San Felice we will furnish you with the means of gaining the town of Atacama, and from there----""  ""Mr. Harris,"" then said Mrs. Weldon, ""do not believe that Dick Sand hesitates to accept your offers"". ""No, Mrs. Weldon, no; surely I do not hesitate,"" replied the young novice; ""but I cannot help regretting not being stranded a few degrees farther north or farther south. We should have been in proximity to a port, and that circumstance, in facilitating our return to our country, would prevent us from taxing Mr. Harris's good will"".

4875,"""I repeat to you that too rarely have I occasion to find myself again in the presence of my compatriots. For me it is a real pleasure to oblige you"". ""We accept your offer, Mr. Harris,"" replied Mrs. Weldon; ""but I should not wish, however, to deprive you of your horse. I am a good walker----""  ""And I am a very good walker,"" replied Harris, bowing. ""Accustomed to long journeys across the pampas, it is not I who will keep back our caravan. No, Mrs. Weldon, you and your little Jack will use this horse. Besides, it is possible that we may meet some of the farm servants on the way, and, as they will be mounted--well, they will yield their horses to us"".

""Tom, my friends,"" replied Dick Sand, turning to the blacks, ""it only remains for us to make preparations for departure. Let us select, then, from among the provisions on hand, those which can be most easily transported, and let us make packs, of which each will take his share"".

4877,"All was agreed upon, and to hasten the departure, each went to work. However, they had only to think of feeding the little troop for the journey from the sea-coast to the farm, that is to say, for a march of ten days. ""But, before setting out, Mr. Harris,"" said Mrs. Weldon, ""before accepting your hospitality, I beg you to accept ours. We offer it to you with our best wishes"". ""I accept, Mrs. Weldon; I accept with eagerness,"" replied Harris, gayly. ""In a few minutes our breakfast will be ready"". ""Good, Mrs. Weldon.

4878,"asked Dick Sand. ""As you please, my young friend,"" replied Harris. ""Come; I shall make you acquainted with the lower course of this river"". Both set out. During this time, Hercules was sent in search of the entomologist. Faith, Cousin Benedict was very uneasy indeed about what was passing around him. He was then wandering on the summit of the cliff in quest of an ""unfindable"" insect, which, however, he did not find. Hercules brought him back against his will. Mrs. Weldon informed him that departure was decided upon, and that, for ten days, they must travel to the interior of the country. Cousin Benedict replied that he was ready to set out, and that he would not ask better than to cross America entirely, provided they would let him ""collect"" on the way.",test,0,1,0,asked please young friend replied shall make acquainted lower course river set time sent search entomologist uneasy indeed passing around wandering summit cliff quest insect however find brought back informed departure decided upon ten days must travel interior country replied ready set would ask better cross entirely provided would let way
4879,"Mrs. Weldon then occupied herself, with Nan's assistance, in preparing a comfortable repast--a good precaution before setting out. During this time, Harris, accompanied by Dick Sand, had turned the angle of the cliff. Both followed the high bank, over a space of three hundred steps. There, a horse, tied to a tree, gave joyous neighing at the approach of his master. It was a vigorous beast, of a species that Dick Sand could not recognize. Neck and shoulders long, loins short, and hindquarters stretched out, shoulders flat, forehead almost pointed. This horse offered, however, distinctive signs of those races to which we attribute an Arabian origin. ""You see, my young friend,"" said Harris, ""that it is a strong animal, and you may count on it not failing you on the route"". Harris detached his horse, took it by the bridle, and descended the steep bank again, preceding Dick Sand. The latter had thrown a rapid glance, as well over the river as toward the forest which shut up its two banks.",test,0,2,0,occupied assistance preparing comfortable repasta good precaution setting time accompanied turned angle cliff followed high bank space three hundred steps horse tied tree gave joyous neighing approach master vigorous beast species could recognize shoulders long loins short hindquarters stretched shoulders flat forehead almost pointed horse offered however distinctive signs races attribute origin see young friend said strong animal may count failing route detached horse took bridle descended steep bank preceding latter thrown rapid glance well river toward forest shut two banks
4880,"But he saw nothing of a nature to make him uneasy. However, when he had rejoined the American, he suddenly gave him the following question, which the latter could little expect:  ""Mr. Harris,"" he asked, ""you have not met a Portuguese, named Negoro, in the night""? ""Negoro""? replied Harris, in the tone of a man who does not understand what is said. ""Who is this Negoro""? ""He was the cook on board,"" replied Dick Sand, ""and he has disappeared"". ""Drowned, perhaps,"" said Harris. ""No, no,"" replied Dick Sand. ""Yesterday evening he was still with us, but during the night he has left us, and he has probably ascended the steep bank of this river.

4881,"""I have met nobody,"" replied the American; ""and if your cook has ventured alone into the forest, he runs a great risk of going astray. Perhaps we shall overtake him on the way"". ""Yes; perhaps""! replied Dick Sand. When the two returned to the grotto, breakfast was ready. It was composed, like the supper of the evening before, of alimentary conserves, of corned beef and of biscuit. Harris did honor to it, like a man whom nature had endowed with a great appetite. ""Let us go,"" said he; ""I see that we shall not die of hunger on the way! I shall not say as much for that poor devil of a Portuguese, of whom our young friend has spoken"".

4882,"said Mrs. Weldon, ""Dick Sand has told you that we have not seen Negoro again""? ""Yes, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied the novice. ""I desired to know if Mr. Harris had not met him"". ""No,"" replied Harris; ""so let us leave that deserter where he is, and think of our departure--whenever you are ready, Mrs. Weldon"". Each took the pack which was intended for him. Mrs. Weldon, assisted by Hercules, placed herself on the horse, and the ungrateful little Jack, with his gun strapped on his back, straddled the animal without even thinking of thanking him who had put that excellent beast at his disposal. Jack, placed before his mother, then said to her that he would know how to lead the gentleman's horse very well. They then gave him the bridle to hold, and he did not doubt that he was the veritable head of the caravan. *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER XVI.

4883,"It was not without a certain apprehension--nothing seemed to justify it, however--that Dick Sand, three hundred steps from the steep bank of the river, penetrated into the thick forest, the difficult paths of which he and his companions were going to follow for ten days. On the contrary, Mrs. Weldon herself, a woman and a mother, whom the perils would make doubly anxious, had every confidence. Two very serious motives had contributed to reassure her; first, because this region of the pampas was neither very formidable on account of the natives, nor on account of the animals which were found there; next, because, under the direction of Harris, of a guide so sure of himself as the American appeared to be, they could not be afraid of going astray. Here is the order of proceeding, which, as far as possible, would be observed during the journey:  Dick Sand and Harris, both armed, one with his long gun, the other with a Remington, kept at the head of the little troop. Then came Bat and Austin, also armed, each with a gun and a cutlass. Behind them followed Mrs. Weldon and little Jack, on horseback; then Nan and Tom. In the rear, Acteon, armed with the fourth Remington, and Hercules, with a hatchet in his belt, closed the march. Dingo went backwards and forwards, and, as Dick Sand remarked, always like an uneasy dog seeking a scent. The dog's ways had visibly changed since the ""Pilgrim's"" shipwreck had cast it on this sea-coast. It seemed agitated, and almost incessantly it kept up a dull grumbling, rather lamentable than furious.",test,0,3,0,without certain apprehensionnothing seemed justify howeverthat three hundred steps steep bank river penetrated thick forest difficult paths companions going follow ten days contrary woman mother perils would make doubly anxious every confidence serious motives contributed reassure first region pampas neither formidable account natives account animals found next direction guide sure appeared could afraid going astray order proceeding far possible would observed journey armed one long gun kept head little troop came also armed gun cutlass followed little horseback rear armed fourth hatchet belt closed march went backwards forwards remarked always like uneasy dog seeking scent dogs ways visibly changed since shipwreck cast seacoast seemed agitated almost incessantly kept dull grumbling rather lamentable furious
4884,"That was remarked by all, though no one could explain it. As to Cousin Benedict, it had been as impossible to assign him an order of marching as Dingo. Unless he had been held by a string, he would not have kept it. His tin box strapped to his shoulder, his net in his hand, his large magnifying glass suspended to his neck, sometimes behind, sometimes in front, he scampered away among the high herbs, watching for orthopters or any other insect in ""pter,"" at the risk of being bit by some venomous serpent. During the first hour Mrs. Weldon, uneasy, called him back twenty times. It was no use. ""Cousin Benedict,"" she finished by saying to him, ""I beg you very seriously not to go far away, and I urge you for the last time to pay attention to my entreaties"". ""Meanwhile, cousin,"" replied the intractable entomologist, ""when I perceive an insect""? ""When you perceive an insect,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, ""you would do well to let it go in peace, or you will put me under the necessity of taking your box away from you"".

4885,"cried Cousin Benedict, as if it were a question of snatching away his heart. ""Your box and your net,"" added Mrs. Weldon, pitilessly. ""My net, cousin! And why not my glasses? You will not dare! No; you will not dare""! ""Even, your glasses, which I forgot. I thank you, Cousin Benedict, for reminding me that I have that means of making you blind, and, in that way, forcing you to be wise"". This triple menace had the effect of making him keep quiet--this unsubmissive cousin--for about an hour. Then he began to go away again, and, as he would do the same, even without net, without box, and without glasses, they were obliged to let him do as he pleased.",test,0,1,1,cried question snatching away heart box net added pitilessly net cousin glasses dare dare glasses forgot thank reminding means making blind way forcing wise triple menace effect making keep quietthis unsubmissive cousinfor hour began go away would even without net without box without glasses obliged let pleased
4886,"But Hercules undertook to watch him closely--which quite naturally became one of his duties--and it was agreed that he would act with Cousin Benedict as the latter would with an insect; that is, that he would catch him, if necessary, and bring him back as delicately as the other would with the rarest of the lepidopters. That rule made, they troubled themselves no more about Cousin Benedict. The little troop, it has been seen, was well armed, and guarded itself carefully. But, as Harris repeated, there was no encounter to fear except with wandering Indians, and they would probably see none. At all events, the precautions taken would suffice to keep them respectful. The paths which wound across the thick forest did not merit that name. They were rather the tracks of animals than the tracks of men. They could only be followed with difficulty. So, in fixing the average distance that the little troop would make in a march of twelve hours at only five or six miles, Harris had calculated wisely.

4887,"The sun mounted toward the zenith, spreading in waves his almost perpendicular rays. On the plain this heat would be unbearable, Harris took care to remark; but, under those impenetrable branches, they bore it easily and with impunity. The greater part of the trees of this forest were unknown, as well to Mrs. Weldon as to her companions, black or white. However, an expert would remark that they were more remarkable for their quality than for their height. Here, it was the ""banhinia,"" or iron wood; there, the ""molompi,"" identical with the ""pterocarpe,"" a solid and light wood, fit for making the spoons used in sugar manufactories or oars, from the trunk of which exuded an abundant resin; further on, ""fusticks,"" or yellow wood, well supplied with coloring materials, and lignum-vitæs, measuring as much as twelve feet in diameter, but inferior in quality to the ordinary lignum-vitæs. While walking, Dick Sand asked Harris the name of these different trees. ""Then you have never been on the coast of South America""? Harris asked him before replying to his question. ""Never,"" replied the novice; ""never, during my voyages, have I had occasion to visit these coasts, and to say the truth, I do not believe that anybody who knew about them has ever spoken to me of them"".

4888,"""No, never"". ""But perhaps Mrs. Weldon has visited this part of the new continent""? asked Harris. ""Americans do not fear voyages, and doubtless----""  ""No, Mr. Harris,"" replied Mrs. Weldon. ""The commercial interests of my husband have never called him except to New Zealand, and I have not had to accompany him elsewhere. Not one of us, then, knows this portion of lower Bolivia"". ""Well, Mrs. Weldon, you and your companions will see a singular country, which contrasts strangely with the regions of Peru, of Brazil, or of the Argentine Republic. Its flora and fauna would astonish a naturalist. Ah! we may say that you have been shipwrecked at a good place, and if we may ever thank chance----""  ""I wish to believe that it is not chance which has led us here, but God, Mr. Harris"".",test,0,1,1,never perhaps visited part new continent asked fear voyages doubtless replied commercial interests husband never called except accompany elsewhere one us knows portion lower companions see singular country contrasts strangely regions flora fauna would astonish naturalist may say shipwrecked good place may ever thank chance wish believe chance led us
4889,"""God! Yes! God""! replied Harris, in the tone of a man who takes little account of providential intervention in the things of this world. Then, since nobody in the little troop knew either the country or its productions, Harris took a pleasure in naming pleasantly the most curious trees of the forest. In truth, it was a pity that, in Cousin Benedict's case, the entomologist was not supplemented by the botanist! If, up to this time, he had hardly found insects either rare or new, he might have made fine discoveries in botany. There was, in profusion, vegetation of all heights, the existence of which in the tropical forests of the New World had not been yet ascertained. Cousin Benedict would certainly have attached his name to some discovery of this kind. But he did not like botany--he knew nothing about it.",test,0,1,0,replied tone man takes little account providential intervention things world since nobody little troop knew either country productions took pleasure naming pleasantly curious trees forest truth pity case entomologist supplemented botanist time hardly found insects either rare new might made fine discoveries botany profusion vegetation heights existence tropical forests yet ascertained would certainly attached name discovery kind like botanyhe knew nothing
4890,"He even, quite naturally, held flowers in aversion, under the pretext that some of them permit themselves to imprison the insects in their corollas, and poison them with their venomous juices. At times, the forest became marshy. They felt under foot quite a network of liquid threads, which would feed the affluents of the little river. Some of the rills, somewhat large, could only be crossed by choosing fordable places. On their banks grew tufts of reeds, to which Harris gave the name of papyrus. He was not mistaken, and those herbaceous plants grew abundantly below the damp banks. Then, the marsh passed, thickets of trees again covered the narrow routes of the forest. Harris made Mrs. Weldon and Dick Sand remark some very fine ebony-trees, much larger than the common ebony-tree, which furnish a wood much blacker and much stronger than that of commerce. Then there were mango-trees, still numerous, though they were rather far from the sea. A kind of fur of white moss climbed them as far as the branches.",test,0,2,0,even quite naturally held flowers aversion pretext permit imprison insects corollas poison venomous juices times forest became marshy felt foot quite network liquid threads would feed affluents little river rills somewhat large could crossed choosing fordable places banks grew tufts reeds gave name papyrus mistaken herbaceous plants grew abundantly damp banks marsh passed thickets trees covered narrow routes forest made remark fine ebonytrees much larger common ebonytree furnish wood much blacker much stronger commerce mangotrees still numerous though rather far sea kind fur white moss climbed far branches
4891,"Their thick shade and their delicious fruit made them precious trees, and meanwhile, according to Harris, not a native would dare to propagate the species. ""Whoever plants a mango-tree dies""! Such is the superstitious maxim of the country. During the second half of this first day of the journey, the little troop, after the midday halt, began to ascend land slightly inclined. They were not as yet the slopes of the chain of the first plane, but a sort of undulating plateau which connected the plain with the mountain. There the trees, a little less compact, sometimes clustered in groups, would have rendered the march easier, if the soil had not been invaded by herbaceous plants. One might believe himself in the jungles of Oriental India. Vegetation appeared to be less luxuriant than in the lower valley of the little river, but it was still superior to that of the temperate regions of the Old or of the New World. Indigo was growing there in profusion, and, according to Harris, this leguminous plant passed with reason for the most usurping plant of the country. If a field came to be abandoned, this parasite, as much despised as the thistle or the nettle, took possession of it immediately.",test,0,2,0,thick shade delicious fruit made precious trees meanwhile according native would dare propagate species plants mangotree dies superstitious maxim country second half first day journey little troop midday halt began ascend land slightly inclined yet slopes chain first plane sort undulating plateau connected plain mountain trees little less compact sometimes clustered groups would rendered march easier soil invaded herbaceous plants might believe jungles appeared less luxuriant lower valley little river still superior temperate regions growing profusion according leguminous plant passed reason usurping plant country field came abandoned parasite much despised thistle nettle took possession immediately
4892,"One tree seemed lacking in this forest, which ought to be very common in this part of the new continent; it was the caoutchouc-tree. In fact, the ""ficus primoides,"" the ""castilloa elastica,"" the ""cecropia peltats,"" the ""collophora utilis,"" the ""cameraria letifolia,"" and above all, the ""syphonia elastica,"" which belong to different families, abound in the provinces of South America. And meanwhile, a rather singular thing, there was not a single one to be seen. Now, Dick Sand had particularly promised his friend Jack to show him some caoutchouc trees. So a great deception for the little boy, who figured to himself that gourds, speaking babies, articulate punchinellos, and elastic balloons grew quite naturally on those trees. He complained. ""Patience, my good little man,"" replied Harris. ""We shall find some of those caoutchoucs, and by hundreds, in the neighborhood of the farm"".

4893,"""The most elastic there are. Hold! while waiting, do you want a good fruit to take away your thirst""? And, while speaking, Harris went to gather from a tree some fruits, which seemed to be as pleasant to the taste as those from the peach-tree. ""Are you very sure, Mr. Harris,"" asked Mrs. Weldon, ""that this fruit can do no harm""? ""Mrs. Weldon, I am going to convince you,"" replied the American, who took a large mouthful of one of those fruits. ""It is a mango"". And little Jack, without any more pressing, followed Harris's example, He declared that it was very good, ""those pears,"" and the tree was at once put under contribution. Those mangos belonged to a species whose fruit is ripe in March and April, others being so only in September, and, consequently, their mangos were just in time.

""You will have them, Jack,"" replied Mrs. Weldon, ""because Mr. Harris assures you of it"". ""But that is not all,"" went on Jack. ""My friend Dick has promised me some other thing""! ""What then, has friend Dick promised""? asked Harris, smiling. ""Some humming-birds, sir"". ""And you shall have some humming-birds, my good little man, but farther on--farther on,"" replied Harris.

4895,"The Indians, who know how to weave their feathers artistically, have lavished the most poetical names on those jewels of the flying race. They call them either the ""rays"" or the ""hairs of the sun"". Here, it is ""the little king of the flowers;"" there, ""the celestial flower that comes in its flight to caress the terrestrial flower"". It is again ""the bouquet of jewels, which sparkles in the fire of the day"". It can be believed that their imagination would know how to furnish a new poetical appellation for each of the one hundred and fifty species which constitute this marvelous tribe of humming-birds. Meanwhile, however numerous these humming-birds might be in the forests of Bolivia, little Jack was obliged to still content himself with Harris's promise. According to the American, they were still too close to the coast, and the humming-birds did not like these deserts so near the ocean. The presence of man did not frighten them at the ""hacienda;"" they heard nothing all day but their cry of ""teretere"" and the murmur of their wings, similar to that of a spinning-wheel.

4896,"cried little Jack. The surest method of getting there--to the ""hacienda"" of San Felice--was not to stop on the road. Mrs. Weldon and her companions only took the time absolutely necessary for repose. The aspect of the forest already changed. Between the less crowded trees large clearings opened here and there. The sun, piercing the green carpet, then showed its structure of red, syenite granite, similar to slabs of lapis-lazuli. On some heights the sarsaparilla abounded, a plant with fleshy tubercles, which formed an inextricable tangle. The forest, with the narrow paths, was better for them. Before sunset the little troop were about eight miles from the point of departure. This journey had been made without accident, and even without great fatigue.",test,0,1,0,cried little surest method getting thereto stop road companions took time absolutely necessary repose aspect forest already changed less crowded trees large clearings opened sun piercing green carpet showed structure red syenite granite similar slabs lapislazuli heights sarsaparilla abounded plant fleshy tubercles formed inextricable tangle forest narrow paths better sunset little troop eight miles point departure journey made without accident even without great fatigue
4897,"It is true, it was the first journey on the march, and no doubt the following halting places would be rougher. By a common consent they decided to make a halt at this place. The question then was, not to establish a real camp, but to simply organize a resting-place. One man on guard, relieved every two hours, would suffice to watch during the night, neither the natives nor the deer being truly formidable. They found nothing better for shelter than an enormous mango-tree, whose large branches, very bushy, formed a kind of natural veranda. If necessary, they could nestle in the branches. Only, on the arrival of the little troop, a deafening concert arose from the top of the tree. The mango served as a perch for a colony of gray parrots, prattling, quarrelsome, ferocious birds, which set upon living birds, and those who would judge them from their congeners which Europe keeps in cages, would be singularly mistaken. These parrots jabbered with such a noise that Dick Sand thought of firing at them to oblige them to be silent, or to put them to flight.

It was composed of conserves and biscuit. A little rill, which wound under the plants, furnished drinkable water, which they did not drink without improving it with a few drops of rum. As to _dessert_, the mango was there with its juicy fruit, which the parrots did not allow to be picked without protesting with their abominable cries. At the end of the supper it began to be dark. The shade rose slowly from the ground to the tops of the trees, from which the foliage soon stood out like a fine tracery on the more luminous background of the sky. The first stars seemed to be shining flowers, which twinkled at the end of the last branches. The wind went down with the night, and no longer trembled in the branches of the trees.

4899,"Nature was going to rest, and inviting every living being to follow her in this deep sleep. Preparations for retiring had to be of a very primitive character. ""Shall we not light a large fire for the night""? Dick Sand asked the American. ""What's the good""? replied Harris.

""Mrs. Weldon,"" replied the American, ""you do too much honor to the deer of this country. Indeed, they fear man more than he fears them"". ""We are in a wood,"" said Jack, ""and there is always beasts in the woods"". ""There are woods and woods, my good little man, as there are beasts and beasts,"" replied Harris, laughing.

""Are they bad""? asked little Jack. ""Phew""! replied Harris; ""a native has little fear of attacking those animals, and we are strong. Stay! Hercules would be strong enough to crush two jaguars at once, one in each hand""! ""You will watch well, Hercules,"" then said little Jack, ""and if a beast comes to bite us----""  ""It is I who will bite it, Mr. Jack""! replied Hercules, showing his mouth, armed with superb teeth.

4905,"Mrs. Weldon, lying near her, gave a last kiss to her little boy, and her tired eyes quickly closed for the night. A few moments later Hercules brought back to the camp Cousin Benedict, who had just gone off to commence a chase for pyrophores. They are ""cocuyos,"" or luminous flies, which the stylish put in their hair, like so many living gems. These insects which throw a bright and bluish light from two spots situated at the base of their corselet, are very numerous in South America. Cousin Benedict then counted on making a large collection, but Hercules did not leave him time, and, in spite of his recriminations, the negro brought him to the halting-place. That was because, when Hercules had orders, he executed them with military preciseness, which, no doubt, prevented the incarceration of a notable quantity of luminous flies in the entomologist's tin box. A few moments after, with the exception of the giant, who was watching, all were reposing in a profound sleep. CHAPTER XVII. A HUNDRED MILES IN TWO DAYS.

4906,"There is everything in this morning concert: clucking, grunting, croaking, sneering, barking, and almost ""speaking,"" if one may make use of this word, which completes the series of different noises. There are the monkeys who thus salute the daybreak. There we meet the little ""marikina,"" the marmoset with a speckled mask; the ""mono gris,"" the skin of which the Indians use to recover the batteries of their guns; the ""sagous,"" recognizable from their long bunches of hair, and many others, specimens of this numerous family. Of these various four-handed animals, the most remarkable are decidedly the ""gueribas,"" with curling tails and a face like Beelzebub. When the sun rises, the oldest of the band, with an imposing and mysterious voice, sings a monotonous psalm. It is the baritone of the troop. The young tenors repeat after him the morning symphony. The Indians say then that the ""gueribas"" recite their _pater-nosters_. But, on this day, it seemed that the monkeys did not offer their prayer, for no one heard them; and, meanwhile, their voice is loud, for it is produced by the rapid vibration of a kind of bony drum, formed by a swelling of the hyoides bone in the neck. In short, for one reason or for another, neither the ""gueribas,"" nor the ""sagous,"" nor any other four-handed animals of this immense forest, sang, on this morning, their usual concert.",test,0,3,0,everything morning concert clucking grunting croaking sneering barking almost one may make use word completes series different noises monkeys thus salute daybreak meet little marmoset speckled mask gris skin use recover batteries guns recognizable long bunches hair many others specimens numerous family various fourhanded animals remarkable decidedly curling tails face like sun rises oldest band imposing mysterious voice sings monotonous psalm baritone troop young tenors repeat morning symphony say recite day seemed monkeys offer prayer one heard meanwhile voice loud produced rapid vibration kind bony drum formed swelling hyoides bone neck short one reason another neither fourhanded animals immense forest sang morning usual concert
4907,"This would not have satisfied the wandering Indians. Not that these natives appreciate this kind of strange choral music, but they willingly give chase to the monkeys, and if they do, it is because the flesh of this animal is excellent, above all, when it is smoke-dried. Dick Sand, of course, could not be familiar with the habits of the ""gueribas,"" neither were his companions, or this not hearing them would have undoubtedly been a subject of surprise. They awoke then, one after the other, much refreshed by these few hours of repose, which no alarm had come to disturb. Little Jack was not the last to stretch his arms. His first question was, to ask if Hercules had eaten a wolf during the night. No wolf had shown himself, and consequently Hercules had not yet breakfasted. All, besides, were fasting like him, and after the morning prayer, Nan occupied herself preparing the repast. The bill of fare was that of the supper of the night before, but with appetites sharpened by the morning air of the forest, no one dreamed of being difficult to please. It was necessary, above all, to gather strength for a good day's march, and they did it.",test,0,2,0,would satisfied wandering natives appreciate kind strange choral music willingly give chase monkeys flesh animal excellent smokedried course could familiar habits neither companions hearing would undoubtedly subject surprise awoke one much refreshed hours repose alarm come disturb last stretch arms first question ask eaten wolf night wolf shown consequently yet breakfasted besides fasting like morning prayer occupied preparing repast bill fare supper night appetites sharpened morning air forest one dreamed difficult please necessary gather strength good days march
4908,"For the first time, perhaps, Cousin Benedict comprehended that to eat was not an action indifferent or useless to life; only, he declared that he had not come to ""visit"" this country to walk with his hands in his pockets, and that, if Hercules prevented him from chasing the ""cocuyos,"" and other luminous flies, Hercules would have some trouble with him. This threat did not seem to frighten the giant to any great extent. However, Mrs. Weldon took him aside and told him that, perhaps, he might allow his big baby to run to the right and left, but on condition that he did not lose sight of him. It would not do to completely sever Cousin Benedict from the pleasures so natural to his age. At seven o'clock in the morning, the little troop took up their journey toward the east, preserving the order of march that had been adopted the previous day. It was always the forest. On this virgin soil, where the heat and the moisture agreed to produce vegetation, it might well be thought that the reign of growth appeared in all its power. The parallel of this vast plateau was almost confounded with tropical latitudes, and, during certain months in summer, the sun, in passing to the zenith, darted its perpendicular rays there. There was, therefore, an enormous quantity of imprisoned heat in this earth, of which the subsoil preserved the damp. Also, nothing could be more magnificent than this succession of forests, or rather this interminable forest.",test,0,2,0,first time perhaps comprehended eat action indifferent useless life declared come country walk hands pockets prevented chasing luminous flies would trouble threat seem frighten giant great extent took aside told perhaps might allow big baby run right left condition lose sight would completely sever pleasures natural age seven oclock morning little troop took journey toward east preserving order march adopted previous day always forest virgin soil heat moisture agreed produce vegetation might well thought reign growth appeared power parallel vast plateau almost confounded tropical latitudes certain months summer sun passing zenith darted perpendicular rays therefore enormous quantity imprisoned heat earth subsoil preserved damp nothing could magnificent succession forests rather interminable forest
4909,"Meanwhile, Dick Sand had not failed to observe this--that, according to Harris, they were in the region of the pampas. Now, pampas is a word from the ""quichna"" language, which signifies a plain. Now, if his recollections did not deceive him, he believed that these plains presented the following characteristics: Lack of water, absence of trees, a failure of stones, an almost luxuriant abundance of thistles during the rainy season, thistles which became almost shrubby with the warm season, and then formed impenetrable thickets; then, also, dwarf trees, thorny shrubs, the whole giving to these plains a rather arid and desolate aspect. Now, it had not been thus, since the little troop, guided by the American, had left the coast. The forest had not ceased to spread to the limits of the horizon. No, this was not the pampas, such as the young novice had imagined them. Had nature, as Harris had told him, been able to make a region apart from the plateau of Atacama, of which he knew nothing, if it did not form one of the most vast deserts of South America, between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean? On that day Dick Sand propounded some questions on this subject, and expressed to the American the surprise he felt at this singular appearance of the pampas. But he was quickly undeceived by Harris, who gave him the most exact details about this part of Bolivia, thus witnessing to his great knowledge of the country.

4910,"""The true pampa is indeed such as the books of travels have depicted it to you, that is, a plain rather arid, and the crossing of which is often difficult. It recalls our savannahs of North America--except that these are a little marshy. Yes, such is indeed the pampa of the Rio Colorado, such are the ""llanos"" of the Orinoco and of Venezuela. But here, we are in a country, the appearance of which even astonishes me. It is true, it is the first time I have followed this route across the plateau, a route which has the advantage of shortening our journey. But, if I have not yet seen it, I know that it presents an extraordinary contrast to the veritable pampa. As to this one, you would find it again, not between the Cordilleras of the west and the high chain of the Andes, but beyond the mountains, over all that eastern part of the continent which extends as far as the Atlantic"". ""Must we then clear the Andes range""? Dick Sand asked, quickly.

""In fact,"" replied Dick Sand, ""it would be better to ascend or descend the coast"". ""Oh! a hundred times""! replied Harris.

""I know indeed that this forest is like an immense sea, or rather like the bottom of a sea, where a sailor himself could not take the latitude nor recognize his position. But accustomed to traveling in the woods, I know how to find my route only by the inclination of certain trees, by the direction of their leaves, by the movement or the composition of the soil, by a thousand details which escape you! Be sure of it, I will lead you, you and yours, where you ought to go""! All these things were said very clearly by Harris. Dick Sand and he, at the head of the troop, often talked without any one mingling in their conversation. If the novice felt some doubts that the American did not always succeed in scattering, he preferred to keep them to himself. The 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th of April passed in this manner, without any incident to mark the journey.",test,0,2,0,fear going astray forests cross first time asked young friend replied know indeed forest like immense sea rather like bottom sea sailor could take latitude recognize position accustomed traveling woods know find route inclination certain trees direction leaves movement composition soil thousand details escape sure lead ought go things said clearly head troop often talked without one mingling conversation novice felt doubts always succeed scattering preferred keep passed manner without incident mark journey
4913,"They did not make more than eight to nine miles in twelve hours. The times consecrated to eating or repose came at regular intervals, and though a little fatigue was felt already, the sanitary condition was still very satisfactory. Little Jack began to suffer a little from this life in the woods, to which he was not accustomed, and which was becoming very monotonous for him. And then all the promises which had been made him had not been kept. The caoutchouc jumping-jacks, the humming-birds, all those seemed constantly to recede. There had also been a question of showing him the most beautiful parrots in the world, and they ought not to be wanting in these rich forests. Where, then, were the popinjays with green plumage, almost all originally from these countries, the _aras_, with naked cheeks, with long pointed tails, with glittering colors, whose paws never rest on the earth, and the ""camindes,"" which are more peculiar to tropical countries, and the many-colored she-parrots, with feathered faces, and finally all those prattling birds which, according to the Indians, still speak the language of extinct tribes?

4914,"On the two continents they fill the houses with their insupportable chattering, and, of all the family of the ""psittacius,"" they are the ones which learn to speak most easily. It must be said, besides, that if Jack was not contented, Cousin Benedict was no more so. He had been allowed to wander a little to the right or to the left during the march. However, he had not found any insect which was fit to enrich his collection. Even the ""pyrophores"" obstinately refused to show themselves to him, and attract him by the phosphorescences of their corselet. Nature seemed truly to mock the unhappy entomologist, whose temper was becoming cross. For four days more the march toward the northeast was continued in the same way. On the 16th of April the distance traversed from the coast could not be estimated at less than one hundred miles. If Harris had not gone astray--and he affirmed it without hesitation--the Farm of San Felice was no more than twenty miles from the halting place of that day.

4915,"Meanwhile, though the plateau had been almost entirely crossed in its middle part, not a native, not a wanderer had been encountered under the immense forest. More than once, without saying anything about it, Dick Sand regretted being unable to go ashore on some other point of the coast. More to the south, or more to the north, villages, hamlets, or plantations would not have been lacking, and long before this Mrs. Weldon and her companions would have found an asylum. But, if the country seemed to be abandoned by man, animals showed themselves more frequently during these last days. At times was heard a kind of long, plaintive cry, that Harris attributed to some of those large tardi-grades, habitual denizens of those vast wooded regions, named ""ais"". On that day, also, during the midday halt, a hissing passed through the air, which made Mrs. Weldon very uneasy, because it was so strange. ""What is that""? ' she asked, rising hastily.

4916,"They might fear, in fact, that some reptile would glide among the plants to the halting place. It would be nothing astonishing if it were one of those enormous ""sucurus,"" kinds of boas, which sometimes measure forty feet in length. But Harris reminded Dick Sand that the blacks were already following, and he reassured Mrs. Weldon. According to him, that hissing could not be produced by a ""sucuru,"" because that serpent does not hiss; but he indicated the presence of several inoffensive quadrupeds, rather numerous in that country. ""Be reassured, then,"" said he, ""and make no movement which may frighten those animals"". ""But what are they""? asked Dick Sand, who made it like a law of conscience to interrogate and make the American speak--who, however, never required pressing before replying.

""Oh! you will not take three steps,"" replied the American, shaking his head, ""before the whole band will take flight. I beg of you, then, not to trouble yourself"". But Dick Sand had his reasons for being curious. He wished to see, and, gun in hand, he glided among the herbs.

4918,"Their hair, bright red, looked like a cloud of fire under the tall underwood of the forest. ""I had warned you,"" said Harris, when the novice returned to take his place. Those antelopes were so light of foot, that it had been truly impossible to distinguish them; but it was not so with another troop of animals which was signaled the same day. Those could be seen--imperfectly, it is true--but their apparition led to a rather singular discussion between Harris and some of his companions. The little troop, about four o'clock in the afternoon, had stopped for a moment near an opening in the woods, when three or four animals of great height went out of a thicket a hundred steps off, and scampered away at once with remarkable speed. In spite of the American's recommendations, this time the novice, having quickly shouldered his gun, fired at one of these animals. But at the moment when the charge was going off, the weapon had been rapidly turned aside by Harris, and Dick Sand, skilful as he was, had missed his aim. ""No firing; no firing""! said the American.

4920,"said Dick Sand. ""I really do not know what to think,"" replied Harris. ""Have not your eyes deceived you, my young friend, and are not those animals more likely to be ostriches""? ""Ostriches""! repeated Dick Sand and Mrs. Weldon, looking at each other in great surprise. ""Yes, only ostriches,"" repeated Harris. ""But ostriches are birds,"" returned Dick Sand, ""and consequently they have only two feet"". ""Well,"" replied Harris, ""I indeed thought I saw that those animals, which have just made off so rapidly, were bipeds"".

4921,"""Indeed it seemed to me that I saw animals with four legs,"" then said Mrs. Weldon. ""I also,"" added old Tom; then Bat, Acteon, and Austin confirmed those words. ""Ostriches with four legs""! cried Harris, with a burst of laughter. ""That would be ridiculous""! ""So,"" returned Dick Sand, ""we have believed they were giraffes, and not ostriches"". ""No, my young friend, no,"" said Harris. ""You have certainly seen badly. That is explained by the rapidity with which those animals have flown away.

4922,"What the American said was very plausible. Between an ostrich of great height and a giraffe of medium height, seen at a certain distance, it is easy to make a mistake. If it were a question of a beak or a nose, both are none the less joined to the end of a long neck turned backward, and, strictly speaking, it may be said that an ostrich is only a half giraffe. It only needs the hind legs. Then, this biped and this quadruped, passing rapidly, on a sudden may, very properly, be taken one for the other. Besides, the best proof that Mrs. Weldon and the others were mistaken was that there are no giraffes in America. Dick Sand then made this reflection:  ""But I believed that ostriches were not met with in the New World any more than giraffes"". ""Yes, my young friend,"" replied Harris; ""and, indeed, South America possesses a peculiar species. To this species belongs the 'nandon,' which you have just seen"".

4923,"The ""nandon"" is a long-legged bird, rather common in the plains of South America, and its flesh, when it is young, is good to eat. This strong animal, whose height sometimes exceeds two meters, has a straight beak; wings long, and formed of tufted feathers of a bluish shade; feet formed of three claws, furnished with nails--which essentially distinguishes it from the ostriches of Africa. These very exact details were given by Harris, who appeared to be very strongly posted on the manners of the ""nandons"". Mrs. Weldon and her companions were obliged to acknowledge that they had been deceived. ""Besides,"" added Harris, ""possibly we may encounter another band of these ostriches. Well, next time look better, and no longer allow yourselves to takes birds for quadrupeds! But above all, my young friend, do not forget my recommendations, and do not fire on any animal whatsoever. We have no need of hunting to procure food, and no detonation of a fire-arm must announce our presence in this forest"". Meanwhile Dick Sand remained pensive.

4924,"The next day, April 17th, the march was continued, and the American affirmed that twenty-four hours would not pass before the little troop should be installed at the Farm of San Felice.

""Yes,"" replied Harris, ""and although the climate of this plateau is very healthful, it must be acknowledged that in March and April intermittent fevers reign"". ""Doubtless,"" then said Dick Sand, ""but also Nature, who is always and everywhere provident, has put the remedy near the evil""! ""And how is that, my young friend""? asked Harris, who did not seem to understand. ""Are we not, then, in the region of the quinquinas""? replied Dick Sand.

Though they are often of great height, though their leaves are large, their flowers rosy and odoriferous, we do not discover them easily. It is rarely that they grow in groups. They are rather scattered through the forests, and the Indians who collect the quinquina can only recognize them by their foliage, always green"". ""Mr. Harris,"" said Mrs. Weldon, ""if you see one of those trees you will show it to me"". ""Certainly, Mrs. Weldon, but at the farm you will find some sulphate of quinine. That is worth still more to break the fever than the simple bark of the tree"".

4927,"Evening came and the halt was organized for the whole night as usual. Till then it had not rained, but the weather was preparing to change, for a warm mist rose from the soil and soon found a thick fog. They were touching, in fact, on the rainy season. Fortunately, the next day, a comfortable shelter would be hospitably offered to the little troop. There were only a few hours to elapse. Though, according to Harris, who could only establish his calculation by the time which the journey had lasted, they could not be more than six miles from the farm, the ordinary precautions were taken for the night. Tom and his companions would watch one after the other. Dick Sand insisted that nothing should be neglected in that respect. Less than ever, would he depart from his habitual prudence, for a terrible suspicion was incrusted in his mind; but he did not wish to say anything yet.

Dick Sand did not dare to ask Cousin Benedict in what part of the world this redoubtable _tsetse_ was only to be met. And when his companions, after this incident, had returned to their interrupted sleep, Dick Sand, in spite of the fatigue which overwhelmed him, did not close his eyes the whole night. *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER XVIII.",test,0,2,1,cousin least man animals antelopes buffaloes even elephants another thing adorable insect last asked tell us fly fly replied entomologist fly hold fingers flyit famous dipter honor country till one ever found dare ask part world redoubtable met companions incident returned interrupted sleep spite fatigue overwhelmed close eyes whole night
4933,"THE TERRIBLE WORD. It was time to arrive. Extreme lassitude made it impossible for Mrs. Weldon to continue any longer a journey made under such painful conditions. Her little boy, crimson during the fits of fever, very pale during the intermissions, was pitiable to see. His mother extremely anxious, had not been willing to leave Jack even in the care of the good Nan. She held him, half-lying, in her arms. Yes, it was time to arrive. But, to trust to the American, on the very evening of this day which was breaking--the evening of the 18th of April, the little troop should finally reach the shelter of the ""hacienda"" of San Felice.

4934,"Dick Sand, Nan, Tom, and his companions had supported the fatigues of the journey better. Their provisions, although they were commencing to get exhausted, had not become injured, and their condition was satisfactory. As for Harris, he seemed made for the difficulties of these long journeys across the forests, and it did not appear that fatigue could affect him. Only, in proportion as he neared the farm, Dick Sand observed that he was more preoccupied and less frank in behavior than before. The contrary would have been more natural. This was, at least, the opinion of the young novice, who had now become more than suspicious of the American. And meanwhile, what interest could Harris have in deceiving them? Dick Sand could not have explained it, but he watched their guide more closely. The American probably felt himself suspected by Dick Sand, and, no doubt, it was this mistrust which made him still more taciturn with ""his young friend"". The march had been resumed.",test,0,1,0,companions supported fatigues journey better provisions although commencing get exhausted become injured condition satisfactory seemed made difficulties long journeys across forests appear fatigue could affect proportion neared farm observed preoccupied less frank behavior contrary would natural least opinion young novice become suspicious meanwhile interest could deceiving could explained watched guide closely probably felt suspected doubt mistrust made still taciturn young friend march resumed
4935,"In the forest, less thick, the trees were scattered in groups, and no longer formed impenetrable masses. Was it, then, the true pampas of which Harris had spoken? During the first hours of the day, no accident happened to aggravate the anxieties that Dick Sand felt. Only two facts were observed by him. Perhaps they were not very important, but in these actual junctures, no detail could be neglected. It was the behavior of Dingo which, above all, attracted more especially the young man's attention. In fact the dog, which, during all this journey, had seemed to be following a scent, became quite different, and that almost suddenly. Until then, his nose to the ground, generally smelling the herbs or the shrubs, he either kept quiet, or he made a sort of sad, barking noise, like an expression of grief or of regret. Now, on this day, the barking of the singular animal became like bursts, sometimes furious, such as they formerly were when Negoro appeared on the deck of the ""Pilgrim"". A suspicion crossed suddenly Dick Sand's mind, and it was confirmed by Tom, who said to him:  ""How very singular, Mr. Dick!",test,0,2,0,forest less thick trees scattered groups longer formed impenetrable masses true pampas spoken first hours day accident happened aggravate anxieties felt two facts observed important actual junctures detail could neglected behavior attracted especially young mans attention fact dog journey seemed following scent became quite different almost suddenly nose ground generally smelling herbs shrubs either kept quiet made sort sad barking noise like expression grief regret day barking singular animal became like bursts sometimes furious formerly appeared deck suspicion crossed suddenly mind confirmed said singular
4936,"Dingo no longer smells the ground as he did yesterday! His nose is in the air, he is agitated, his hair stands up! One would think he scented in the distance----""  ""Negoro, is it not so""? replied Dick Sand, who seized the old black's arm, and signed to him to speak in a low voice. ""Negoro, Mr. Dick! May it not be that he has followed our steps""? ""Yes, Tom; and that at this moment even he may not be very far from us"". ""But why""? said Tom.

""Has he never been here""? murmured Dick Sand. ""It is an incontestable fact that Dingo acts as if this man whom he detests were near us""!

4938,"This name had its usual effect upon him, and he darted forward, as if Negoro had been hidden behind some thicket. Harris had witnessed all this scene. With his lips a little drawn, he approached the novice. ""What did you ask Dingo then""? said he. ""Oh, not much, Mr. Harris,"" replied old Tom, jokingly. ""We asked him for news of the ship-companion whom we have lost""! ""Ah""! said the American, ""the Portuguese, the ship's cook of whom you have already spoken to me""?

4939,"replied Tom. ""One would say, to hear Dingo, that Negoro is in the vicinity"". ""How could he get as far as this""? replied Harris. ""He never was in this country that I know of; at least, he concealed it from us,"" replied Tom. ""It would be astonishing,"" said Harris. ""But, if you wish, we will beat these thickets. It is possible that this poor devil has need of help; that he is in distress"". ""It is useless, Mr. Harris,"" replied Dick Sand.

4940,"He is a man to keep out of trouble"". ""As you please,"" replied Harris. ""Let us go. Dingo, be quiet,"" added Dick Sand, briefly, so as to end the conversation. The second observation made by the novice was in connection with the American horse. He did not appear to ""feel the stable,"" as do animals of his species. He did not suck in the air; he did not hasten his speed; he did not dilate his nostrils; he uttered none of the neighings that indicate the end of a journey. To observe him well, he appeared to be as indifferent as if the farm, to which he had gone several times, however, and which he ought to know, had been several hundreds of miles away. ""That is not a horse near home,"" thought the young novice. And, meanwhile, according to what Harris had said the evening before, there only remained six miles to go, and, of these last six miles, at five o'clock in the evening four had been certainly cleared.",test,0,1,0,man keep trouble please replied us go quiet added briefly end conversation second observation made novice connection horse appear stable animals species suck air hasten speed dilate nostrils uttered none neighings indicate end journey observe well appeared indifferent farm gone several times however ought know several hundreds miles away horse near home thought young novice meanwhile according said evening remained six miles go last six miles five oclock evening four certainly cleared
4941,"Now, if the horse felt nothing of the stable, of which he should have great need, nothing besides announced the approaches to a great clearing, such as the Farm of San Felice must be. Mrs. Weldon, indifferent as she then was to what did not concern her child, was struck at seeing the country still so desolate. What! not a native, not a farm-servant, at such a short distance! Harris must be wild! No! she repulsed this idea. A new delay would have been the death of her little Jack! Meanwhile, Harris always kept in advance, but he seemed to observe the depths of the wood, and looked to the right and left, like a man who was not sure of himself--nor of his road.

4942,"After a plain a mile in extent, the forest, without being as dense as in the west, had reappeared, and the little troop was again lost under the great trees. At six o'clock in the evening they had reached a thicket, which appeared to have recently given passage to a band of powerful animals. Dick Sand looked around him very attentively. At a distance winch far surpassed the human height, the branches were torn off or broken. At the same time the herbs, roughly scattered, exhibited on the soil, a little marshy, prints of steps which could not be those of jaguars, or cougars. Were these, then, the ""ais,"" or some other tardi-graves, whose feet had thus marked the soil? But how, then, explain the break in the branches at such a height? Elephants might have, without doubt, left such imprints, stamped these large traces, made a similar hole in the impenetrable underwood. But elephants are not found in America.

4943,"As yet, they have never been acclimated there. The hypothesis that elephants had passed there was absolutely inadmissible. However that might be, Dick Sand hardly knew how much this inexplicable fact gave him to think about. He did not even question the American on this point. What could he expect from a man who had tried to make him take giraffes for ostriches? Harris would have given him some explanation, more or less imaginative, which would not have changed the situation. At all events, Dick had formed his opinion of Harris. He felt in him a traitor! He only awaited an occasion to unmask his disloyalty, to have the right to do it, and everything told him that this opportunity was near.

4944,"What future, then, awaited the survivors of the ""Pilgrim""? Dick Sand repeated to himself that his responsibility had not ceased with the shipwreck. It was more than ever necessary for him to provide for the safety of those whom the waves had thrown on this coast! This woman, this young child, these blacks--all his companions in misfortune--it was he alone who must save them! But, if he could attempt anything on board ship, if he could act on the sea, here, in the midst of the terrible trials which he foresaw, what part could he take? Dick Sand would not shut his eyes before the frightful reality that each instant made more indisputable. In this juncture he again became the captain of fifteen years, as he had been on the ""Pilgrim"". But he would not say anything which could alarm the poor mother before the moment for action had arrived. And he said nothing, not even when, arrived on the bank of a rather large stream, preceding the little troop about one hundred feet, he perceived enormous animals, which threw themselves under the large plants on the brink.

Hippopotami in America! They continued to march during the whole day, but painfully. Fatigue commenced to retard even the most robust. It was truly time to arrive, or they would be forced to stop.

4946,"Toward four o'clock in the evening, old Tom found, in the grass, an object which attracted his attention. It was an arm, a kind of knife, of a particular shape, formed of a large, curved blade, set in a square, ivory handle, rather roughly ornamented. Tom carried this knife to Dick Sand, who took it, examined it, and, finally, showed it to the American, saying:  ""No doubt the natives are not very far off"". ""That is so,"" replied Harris, ""and meanwhile----""  ""Meanwhile""? repeated Dick Sand, who now steadily looked Harris in the face. ""We should be very near the farm,"" replied Harris, hesitating, ""and I do not recognize----""  ""You are then astray""? quickly asked Dick Sand. ""Astray! no.

""But, during the night, it will be difficult for me to guide you"". ""Never mind that""! replied Dick Sand. ""We are going to halt.

But old Tom, who was helping him in these preparations, stopped suddenly, crying out:  ""Mr. Dick! look! look""! ""What is it, old Tom""? asked Dick Sand, in the calm tone of a man who attends to everything. ""There--there""! cried Tom; ""on those trees--blood stains! --and--on the ground--mutilated limbs""!

Happily, Mrs. Weldon had seen nothing of this horrible spectacle. As for Harris, he kept at a distance, and any one observing him at this moment would have been struck at the change made in him. His face had something ferocious in it. Dingo had rejoined Dick Sand, and before these bloody remains, he barked with rage. The novice had hard work to drive him away. Meanwhile, old Tom, at the sight of these forks, of this broken chain, had remained motionless, as if his feet were rooted in the soil.

4952,"All were under an indefinable impression of anxiety which bordered on terror. Darkness came gradually: soon it was profound. The sky was covered with great stormy clouds. Between the trees in the western horizon they saw some flashes of heat lightning. The wind had fallen; not a leaf moved on the trees. An absolute silence succeeded the noises of the day, and it might be believed that the heavy atmosphere, saturated with electricity, was becoming unfit for the transmission of sounds. Dick Sand, Austin, and Bat watched together. They tried to see, to hear, during this very dark night, if any light whatsoever, or any suspicious noise should strike their eyes or their ears.

His faculty for looking forward did not go so far. Suddenly, about eleven o'clock, a prolonged and grave roaring was heard, with which was mingled a sort of sharper shuddering. Tom stood up and stretched out his hand toward a dense thicket, a mile or more distant. Dick Sand seized his arm, but he could not prevent Tom from crying in a loud voice: ""The lion! the lion""!

A sort of revelation took place in Dick Sand's mind. He was not where he had believed he was! So it was not on the American coast that the ""Pilgrim"" had gone ashore! It was not the Isle of Paques, whose bearing the novice had taken at sea, but some other island situated exactly to the west of this continent, as the Isle of Paques is situated to the west of America.

The speed of his ship, which he could only imperfectly estimate, had been doubled, unknown to him, by the force of the hurricane!

4957,"Behold under what circumstances it was established:  The Mussulmans, after being expelled from Spain, took refuge beyond the Strait on the coast of Africa. The Portuguese, who then occupied that part of the coast, pursued them with fury. A certain number of those fugitives were made prisoners and brought back to Portugal. Reduced to slavery, they constituted the first nucleus of African slaves which has been formed in Western Europe since the Christian Era. But those Mussulmans belonged, for the most part, to rich families, who wished to buy them back for gold. The Portuguese refused to accept a ransom, however large it might be. They had only to make foreign gold. What they lacked were the arms so indispensable then for the work of the growing colonies, and, to say it all, the arms of the slave. The Mussulman families, being unable to buy back their captive relatives, then offered to exchange them for a much larger number of black Africans, whom it was only too easy to carry off. The offer was accepted by the Portuguese, who found that exchange to their advantage, and thus the slave trade was founded in Europe.",test,0,2,0,circumstances established expelled took refuge beyond coast occupied part coast pursued fury certain number fugitives made prisoners brought back slavery constituted first nucleus slaves formed since belonged part rich families wished buy back gold refused accept ransom however large might make foreign gold lacked arms indispensable work growing colonies say arms slave families unable buy back captive relatives offered exchange much larger number black easy carry offer accepted found exchange advantage thus slave trade founded
4958,"Toward the end of the sixteenth century this odious traffic was generally admitted, and it was not repugnant to the still barbarous manners. All the States protected it so as to colonize more rapidly and more surely the isles of the New World. In fact, the slaves of black origin could resist the climate, where the badly acclimated whites, still unfit to support the heat of intertropical climates, would have perished by thousands. The transport of negroes to the American colonies was then carried on regularly by special vessels, and this branch of transatlantic commerce led to the creation of important stations on different points of the African coast. The ""merchandise"" cost little in the country of production, and the returns were considerable. But, necessary as was the foundation of the colonies beyond the sea from all points of view, it could not justify those markets for human flesh. Generous voices soon made themselves heard, which protested against the trade in blacks, and demanded from the European governments a decree of abolition in the name of the principles of humanity. In 1751, the Quakers put themselves at the head of the abolition movement, even in the heart of that North America where, a hundred years later, the War of Secession was to burst forth, to which this question of slavery was not a foreign one. Different States in the North--Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania--decreed the abolition of the slave trade, and freed the slaves brought to their territories at great expense. But the campaign commenced by the Quakers did not limit itself to the northern provinces of the New World.",test,0,3,0,end sixteenth century odious traffic generally admitted repugnant still barbarous manners protected colonize rapidly surely isles fact slaves black origin could resist climate badly acclimated whites still unfit support heat intertropical climates would perished thousands transport negroes colonies carried regularly special vessels branch transatlantic commerce led creation important stations different points coast cost little country production returns considerable necessary foundation colonies beyond sea points view could justify markets human flesh voices soon made heard protested trade blacks demanded governments decree abolition name principles humanity put head abolition movement even heart hundred years later burst forth question slavery foreign one abolition slave trade freed slaves brought territories great expense campaign commenced limit northern provinces
4959,"Slaveholders were warmly attacked beyond the Atlantic. France and England, more particularly, recruited partisans for this just cause. ""Let the colonies perish rather than a principle""! Such was the generous command which resounded through all the Old World, and, in spite of the great political and commercial interests engaged in the question, it was effectively transmitted through Europe. The impetus was given. In 1807, England abolished the slave-trade in her colonies, and France followed her example in 1814. The two powerful nations exchanged a treaty on this subject--a treaty confirmed by Napoleon during the Hundred Days. However, that was as yet only a purely theoretical declaration. The slave-ships did not cease to cross the seas, and to dispose of their ""ebony cargoes"" in colonial ports. More practical measures must be taken in order to put an end to this commerce.",test,0,1,0,warmly attacked beyond particularly recruited partisans cause colonies perish rather principle generous command resounded spite great political commercial interests engaged question effectively transmitted impetus given abolished slavetrade colonies followed example two powerful nations exchanged treaty subjecta treaty confirmed yet purely theoretical declaration slaveships cease cross seas dispose cargoes colonial ports practical measures must taken order put end commerce
4960,"The United States, in 1820, and England, in 1824, declared the slave trade an act of piracy, and those who practised it pirates. As such, they drew on themselves the penalty of death, and they were pursued to the end. France soon adhered to the new treaty; but the States of South America, and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, did not join in the Act of Abolition. The exportation of blacks then continued to their profit, notwithstanding the right of search generally recognized, which was limited to the verification of the flag of suspicious vessels. Meanwhile, the new Law of Abolition had not a retroactive effect. No more new slaves were made, but the old ones had not yet recovered their liberty. It was under those circumstances that England set an example. In May, 1833, a general declaration emancipated all the blacks in the colonies of Great Britain, and in August, 1838, six hundred and seventy thousand slaves were declared free. Ten years later, in 1848, the Republic emancipated the slaves of the French colonies, say about two hundred and sixty thousand blacks. In 1861, the war which broke out between the Federals and Confederates, of the United States, finishing the work of emancipation, extended it to all North America.",test,0,2,0,declared slave trade act piracy practised pirates drew penalty death pursued end soon adhered new treaty colonies join exportation blacks continued profit notwithstanding right search generally recognized limited verification flag suspicious vessels new retroactive effect new slaves made old ones yet recovered liberty circumstances set example general declaration emancipated blacks colonies six hundred seventy thousand slaves declared free years later emancipated slaves colonies say two hundred sixty thousand blacks war broke finishing work emancipation extended
4961,"The three great powers had then accomplished this work of humanity. At the present hour, the trade is no longer carried on, except for the benefit of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, and to satisfy the wants of the populations of the Orient, Turks, or Arabs. Brazil, if she has not yet restored her old slaves to liberty, at least no longer receives new ones, and the children of the blacks are born free there. It is in the interior of Africa, in the prosecution of those bloody wars, waged by the African chiefs among themselves for this man-hunt, that entire tribes are reduced to slavery. Two opposite directions are then given to the caravans: one to the west, toward the Portuguese colony of Angola; the other to the east, on the Mozambique. Of these unfortunate beings, of whom only a small portion arrive at their destination, some are exported, it may be to Cuba, it may be to Madagascar; others to the Arab or Turkish provinces of Asia, to Mecca, or to Muscat. The English and French cruisers can only prevent this traffic to a small extent, as it is so difficult to obtain an effective surveillance over such far-extended coasts. But the figures of these odious exportations, are they still considerable? Yes!

4962,"After these dreadful butcheries the devastated fields are deserted, the burnt villages are without inhabitants, the rivers carry down dead bodies, deer occupy the country. Livingstone, the day after one of these men-hunts, no longer recognized the provinces he had visited a few months before. All the other travelers--Grant, Speke, Burton, Cameron, and Stanley--do not speak otherwise of this wooded plateau of Central Africa, the principal theater of the wars between the chiefs. In the region of the great lakes, over all that vast country which feeds the market of Zanzibar, in Bornou and Fezzan, farther south, on the banks of the Nyassa and the Zambesi, farther west, in the districts of the upper Zaire, which the daring Stanley has just crossed, is seen the same spectacle--ruins, massacres, depopulation. Then will slavery in Africa only end with the disappearance of the black race; and will it be with this race as it is with the Australian race, or the race in New Holland? But the market of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies will close some day. That outlet will be wanting. Civilized nations can no longer tolerate the slave trade! Yes, without doubt; and this year even, 1878, ought to see the enfranchisement of all the slaves still possessed by Christian States.

4963,"It is for them, in fact, that the most important emigration of the blacks is made, as the number of natives snatched from their provinces and brought to the eastern coast annually exceeds forty thousand. Long before the expedition to Egypt the negroes of the Seunaar were sold by thousands to the negroes of the Darfour, and reciprocally. General Bonaparte was able to buy a pretty large number of these blacks, of whom he made organized soldiers, like the Mamelukes. Since then, during this century, of which four-fifths have now passed away, commerce in slaves has not diminished in Africa. On the contrary. And, in fact, Islamism is favorable to the slave trade. The black slave must replace the white slave of former times, in Turkish provinces. So contractors of every origin pursue this execrable traffic on a large scale. They thus carry a supplement of population to those races, which are dying out and will disappear some day, because they do not regenerate themselves by labor. These slaves, as in the time of Bonaparte, often become soldiers.",test,0,2,0,fact important emigration blacks made number natives snatched provinces brought eastern coast annually exceeds forty thousand expedition negroes sold thousands negroes reciprocally able buy pretty large number blacks made organized soldiers like century fourfifths passed away commerce slaves diminished contrary fact favorable slave trade black slave must replace white slave former times provinces contractors every origin pursue execrable traffic large scale thus carry supplement population races dying disappear day regenerate labor slaves time often become soldiers
4964,"With certain nations of the upper Niger, they compose the half of the armies of the African chiefs. Under these circumstances, their fate is not sensibly inferior to that of free men. Besides, when the slave is not a soldier, he is money which has circulation; even in Egypt and at Bornou, officers and functionaries are paid in that money. William Lejean has seen it and has told of it. Such is, then, the actual state of the trade. Must it be added that a number of agents of the great European powers are not ashamed to show a deplorable indulgence for this commerce. Nevertheless, nothing is truer; while the cruisers watch the coasts of the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, the traffic goes on regularly in the interior, the caravans walk on under the eyes of certain functionaries, and massacres, where ten blacks perish to furnish one slave, take place at stated periods! So it will now be understood how terrible were those words just pronounced by Dick Sand. ""Africa!

4965,"Africa of slave-traders and slaves""! And he was not deceived; it was Africa with all its dangers, for his companions and for himself. But on what part of the African continent had an inexplicable fatality landed him? Evidently on the western coast, and as an aggravating circumstance, the young novice was forced to think that the ""Pilgrim"" was thrown on precisely that part of the coast of Angola where the caravans, which clear all that part of Africa, arrive. In fact it was there. It was that country which Cameron on the south and Stanley on the north were going to cross a few years later, and at the price of what efforts! Of this vast territory, which is composed of three provinces, Benguela, Congo, and Angola, there was but little known then except the coast. It extends from the Nourse, in the south, as far as the Zaire in the north, and the two principal towns form two ports, Benguela and St. Paul' de Loanda, the capital of the colony which set off from the kingdom of Portugal. In the interior this country was then almost unknown.

4966,"A pernicious climate, warm and damp lands, which engender fevers, barbarous natives, some of whom are still cannibals, a permanent state of war between tribes, the slave-traders' suspicion of every stranger who seeks to discover the secrets of their infamous commerce; such are the difficulties to surmount, the dangers to overcome in this province of Angola, one of the most dangerous of equatorial Africa. Tuckey, in 1816, had ascended the Congo beyond the Yellala Falls; but over an extent of two hundred miles at the most. This simple halting-place could not give a definite knowledge of the country, and nevertheless, it had caused the death of the greater part of the savants and officers who composed the expedition. Thirty-seven years later, Dr. Livingstone had advanced from the Cape of Good Hope as far as the upper Zambesi. Thence, in the month of November, with a hardihood which has never been surpassed, he traversed Africa from the south to the northwest, cleared the Coango, one of the branches of the Congo, and on the 31st of May, 1854, arrived at St. Paul de Loanda. It was the first view in the unknown of the great Portuguese Colony. Eighteen years after, two daring discoverers crossed Africa from the east to the west, and arrived, one south, the other north, of Angola, after unheard-of difficulties. The first, according to the date, was a lieutenant in the English navy, Verney-Howet Cameron. In 1872, there was reason to fear that the expedition of the American, Stanley, was in great danger. It had been sent to the great lake region in search of Livingstone.",test,0,3,0,pernicious climate warm damp lands engender fevers barbarous natives still cannibals permanent state war tribes slavetraders suspicion every stranger seeks discover secrets infamous commerce difficulties surmount dangers overcome province one dangerous equatorial ascended beyond extent two hundred miles simple haltingplace could give definite knowledge country nevertheless caused death greater part savants officers composed expedition years later advanced far upper month hardihood never surpassed traversed south northwest cleared one branches arrived de first view unknown great years two daring discoverers crossed east west arrived one south north unheardof difficulties first according date lieutenant navy reason fear expedition great danger sent great lake region search
4967,"Lieutenant Cameron offered to go over the same road. The offer was accepted. Cameron, accompanied by Dr. Dillon, Lieutenant Cecil Murphy and Robert Moffat, a nephew of Livingstone, started from Zanzibar. After having crossed Ougogo, he met Livingstone's faithful servants carrying their master's body to the eastern coast. He continued his route to the west, with the unconquerable desire to pass from one coast to the other. He crossed Ounyanyembe, Ougounda, and Kahouele, where he collected the great traveler's papers. Having passed over Tanganyika, and the Bambarre mountains, he reached Loualaba, but could not descend its course. After having visited all the provinces devastated by war and depopulated by the slave trade, Kilemmba, Ouroua, the sources of the Lomane, Oulouda, Lovale, and having crossed the Coanza and the immense forests in which Harris has just entrapped Dick Sand and his companions, the energetic Cameron finally perceived the Atlantic Ocean and arrived at Saint Philip of Benguela.

4968,"We know that this intrepid correspondent of the New York _Herald_, sent in search of Livingstone, had found him on October 30th, 1871, at Oujiji, on Lake Tanganyika. Having so happily accomplished his object for the sake of humanity, Stanley determined to pursue his journey in the interest of geographical science. His object then was to gain a complete knowledge of Loualaba, of which he had only had a glimpse. Cameron was then lost in the provinces of Central Africa, when, in November, 1874, Stanley quitted Bagamoga, on the eastern coast. Twenty-one months after, August 24th, 1876, he abandoned Oujiji, which was decimated by an epidemic of smallpox. In seventy-four days he effected the passage of the lake at N'yangwe, a great slave market, which had been already visited by Livingstone and Cameron. Here he witnessed the most horrible scenes, practised in the Maroungou and Manyouema countries by the officers of the Sultan of Zanzibar. Stanley then took measures to explore the course of the Loualaba and to descend it as far as its mouth. One hundred and forty bearers, engaged at N'yangwe, and nineteen boats, formed the material and the force of his expedition. From the very start he had to fight the cannibals of Ougouson.",test,0,2,0,know intrepid correspondent sent search found happily accomplished object sake humanity determined pursue journey interest geographical science object gain complete knowledge glimpse lost provinces quitted eastern coast months abandoned decimated epidemic smallpox seventyfour days effected passage lake great slave market already visited witnessed horrible scenes practised countries officers took measures explore course descend far mouth hundred forty bearers engaged nineteen boats formed material force expedition start fight cannibals
4969,"From the start, also, he had to attend to the carrying of boats, so as to pass insuperable cataracts. Under the equator, at the point where the Loualaba makes a bend to the northeast, fifty-four boats, manned by several hundred natives, attacked Stanley's little fleet, which succeeded in putting them to flight. Then the courageous American, reascending as far as the second degree of northern latitude, ascertained that the Loualaba was the upper Zaire, or Congo, and that by following its course he could descend directly to the sea. This he did, fighting nearly every day against the tribes that lived near the river. On June 3d, 1877, at the passage of the cataracts of Massassa, he lost one of his companions, Francis Pocock. July 18th he was drawn with his boat into the falls of M'belo, and only escaped death by a miracle. Finally, August 6th, Henry Stanley arrived at the village of Ni-Sanda, four days' journey from the coast. Two days after, at Banza-M'bouko, he found the provisions sent by two merchants from Emboma. He finally rested at this little coast town, aged, at thirty-five years, by over-fatigue and privations, after an entire passage of the African continent, which had taken two years and nine months of his life. However, the course of the Loualaba was explored as far as the Atlantic; and if the Nile is the great artery of the North, if the Zambesi is the great artery of the East, we now know that Africa still possesses in the West the third of the largest rivers in the world--a river which, in a course of two thousand, nine hundred miles, under the names of Loualaba, Zaire, and Congo, unites the lake region with the Atlantic Ocean.",test,0,3,0,start also attend carrying boats pass insuperable cataracts equator point makes bend northeast fiftyfour boats manned several hundred natives attacked little fleet succeeded putting flight courageous reascending far second degree northern latitude ascertained upper following course could descend directly sea fighting nearly every day tribes lived near river passage cataracts lost one companions drawn boat falls escaped death miracle arrived village four days journey coast days found provisions sent two merchants finally rested little coast town aged thirtyfive years overfatigue privations entire passage continent taken two years nine months life course explored far great artery great artery know still possesses third largest rivers worlda river course two thousand nine hundred miles names unites lake region
4970,"However, between these two books of travel--Stanley's and Cameron's--the province of Angola is somewhat better known in this year than in 1873, at that period when the ""Pilgrim"" was lost on the African coast. It was well known that it was the seat of the western slave-trade, thanks to its important markets of Bihe, Cassange, and Kazounde. It was into this country that Dick Sand had been drawn, more than one hundred miles from the coast, with a woman exhausted by fatigue and grief, a dying child, and some companions of African descent, the prey, as everything indicated, to the rapacity of slave merchants. Yes, it was Africa, and not that America where neither the natives, nor the deer, nor the climate are very formidable. It was not that favorable region, situated between the Cordilleras and the coast, where straggling villages abound, and where missions are hospitably opened to all travelers. They were far away, those provinces of Peru and Bolivia, where the tempest would have surely carried the ""Pilgrim,"" if a criminal hand had not changed its course, where the shipwrecked ones would have found so many facilities for returning to their country. It was the terrible Angola, not even that part of the coast inspected by the Portuguese authorities, but the interior of the colony, which is crossed by caravans of slaves under the whip of the driver. What did Dick Sand know of this country where treason had thrown him? Very little; what the missionaries of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had said of it; what the Portuguese merchants, who frequented the road from St. Paul de Loanda to the Zaïre, by way of San Salvador, knew of it; what Dr. Livingstone had written about it, after his journey of 1853, and that would have been sufficient to overwhelm a soul less strong than his.

These two men were Harris and Negoro; and we are going to see now what chance had brought together, on the coast of Angola, the Portuguese come from New Zealand, and the American, whom the business of trader obliged to often traverse this province of Western Africa. Harris and Negoro were seated at the foot of an enormous banyan, on the steep bank of an impetuous stream, which ran between a double hedge of papyrus. The conversation commenced, for the Portuguese and the American had just met, and at first they dwelt on the deeds which had been accomplished during these last hours. ""And so, Harris,"" said Negoro, ""you have not been able to draw this little troop of Captain Sand, as they call this novice of fifteen years, any farther into Angola""? ""No, comrade,"" replied Harris; ""and it is even astonishing that I have succeeded in leading him a hundred miles at least from the coast.

The moral sense is entirely lacking in them, and if they had any, how quickly they would lose it among the frightful atrocities of the African slave trade. But where Harris was right, was when he said that civilization was gradually penetrating those savage countries in the wake of those hardy travelers, whose names are indissoluble linked to the discoveries of Equatorial Africa.

4993,"""But will he get that idea""? asked Negoro. ""Surely,"" replied Harris, ""because he is intelligent, and cannot suspect the danger that awaits him. Dick Sand would not think of returning to the coast by the way we have followed together. He would be lost among these immense forests. He will seek, then, I am sure, to reach one of the rivers that flow toward the coast, so as to descend it on a raft. He has no other plan to take, and I know he will take it"".

A long howl of pain replied to the detonation, and Dingo disappeared between the double row of bushes that bordered the brook. Negoro descended at once to the bottom of the bank.

He remembered, too, that the first compass had been broken, and that the log-line had snapped--a fact which had made it impossible for him to establish the speed of the ""Pilgrim"". ""Yes,"" thought he, ""there remained but one compass on board, one only, the indications of which I could not control! And one night I was awakened by a cry from old Tom. Negoro was there, aft.

Had he been a sailor and known so well how to hide the fact? Was he capable of contriving this odious plot which had thrown the ship on the coast of Africa? At any rate, if obscure points still existed in the past, the present could offer no more of them. The young novice knew only too well that he was in Africa, and very probably in the fatal province of Angola, more than a hundred miles from the coast. He also knew that Harris's treason could no longer be doubted. From this fact, the most simple logic led him to conclude that the American and the Portuguese had long known each other, that a fatal chance had united them on this coast, and that a plan had been concerted between them, the result of which would be dreadful for the survivors of the ""Pilgrim"". And now, why these odious actions? That Negoro wished, at all hazards, to seize Tom and his companions, and sell them for slaves in this slave-trading country, might be admitted.",test,0,2,0,saw hand chain incidents led loss fearfully endangered board miserable man sailor known well hide fact capable contriving odious plot thrown ship coast rate obscure points still existed past present could offer young novice knew well probably fatal province hundred miles coast also knew treason could longer doubted fact simple logic led conclude long known fatal chance united coast plan concerted result would dreadful survivors odious actions wished hazards seize companions sell slaves slavetrading country might admitted

But Mrs. Weldon, this mother, and this young child--what would the wretch do with them? If Dick Sand could have overheard a little of the conversation between Harris and Negoro, he would have known what to expect, and what dangers menaced Mrs. Weldon, the blacks, and himself. The situation was frightful, but the young novice did not yield under it. Captain on board, he remained captain on land. He must save Mrs. Weldon, little Jack, all those whose fate Heaven had placed in his hands. His task was only commencing. He would accomplish it to the end.

""Yes, Mr. Dick, I know it"". ""Well, Tom, not a word of all that, neither to Mrs. Weldon nor to your companions. We must be the only ones to know, the only ones to have any fears"".

5003,"If Harris were detected in open treason before the hour for action, at least the young novice and his companions were not in fear of any immediate danger. In fact, it was the discovery of the irons abandoned by some slaves, and the roaring of the lion, that had caused the American's sudden disappearance. He knew that he was discovered, and he had fled probably before the little party which he guided had reached the place where an attack had been arranged. As for Negoro, whose presence Dingo had certainly recognized during these last days of the march, he must have rejoined Harris, so as to consult with him. At any rate, several hours would pass before Dick Sand and his friends would be assailed, and it was necessary to profit by them. The only plan was to regain the coast as quickly as possible. This coast, as the young novice had every reason to believe, was that of Angola. After having reached it, Dick Sand would try to gain, either to the north or to the south, the Portuguese settlements, where his companions could await in safety some opportunity to return to their country. But, to effect this return to the coast, should they take the road already passed over?

5004,"In fact, it would have been difficult, not to say imprudent, to recommence this difficult journey through the forest, which, besides, could only tend to bring them out at the place they had started from. This would also allow Negoro's accomplices to follow an assured track. The only thing they could do was to cross a river, without leaving any traces, and, later on, to descend its course. At the same time, there was less to fear from an attack by animals, which by a happy chance had so far kept at a good distance. Even the animosity of the natives, under these circumstances, seemed less important. Once embarked on a solid raft, Dick Sand and his companions, being well armed, would be in the best condition to defend themselves. The whole thing was to find the river. It must be added that, given the actual state of Mrs. Weldon and her little Jack, this mode of traveling would be the most suitable. Arms would not fail to carry the sick child.

5005,"But this would require two men out of five, and Dick Sand wished, with good reason, that all his companions might be free in their movements in case of a sudden attack. And then, in descending the current of a river, the young novice would find himself in his element! The question now was, whether a navigable stream of water existed in the neighborhood. Dick Sand thought it probable, and for this reason: The river which emptied into the Atlantic at the place where the ""Pilgrim"" had stranded could not ascend much to the north, nor much to the east, of the province, because a chain of mountains quite close to them--those which they had mistaken for the Cordilleras--shut in the horizon on these two sides. Then, either the river descended from these heights, or it made a bend toward the south, and, in these two cases, Dick Sand could not take long to find the course. Perhaps, even before reaching the river--for it had a right to this qualification, being a direct tributary of the ocean--one of its affluents would be met with which would suffice for the transport of the little party. At any rate, a stream of some sort could not be far away. In fact, during the last miles of the journey the nature of the earth had been modified. The declivities diminished and became damp.

5006,"During the last day's march the caravan had kept along one of these rivulets, whose waters, reddened with oxyde of iron, eat away its steep, worn banks. To find it again could not take long, or be very difficult. Evidently they could not descend its impetuous course, but it would be easy to follow it to its junction with a more considerable, possibly a navigable, affluent. Such was the very simple plan which Dick Sand determined upon, after having conferred with old Tom. Day came, all their companions gradually awoke. Mrs. Weldon placed little Jack in Nan's arms.

5007,"The young novice thought that, while letting his companions believe that they were treading on the soil of Bolivia, it would not do to hide from them the American's treason. So he said, without hesitation: ""Harris is no longer here"". ""Has he, then, gone ahead""? asked Mrs. Weldon. ""He has fled, Mrs. Weldon,"" replied Dick Sand. ""This Harris is a traitor, and it is according to Negoro's plan that he led us this far"". ""For what motive""? quickly asked Mrs. Weldon.

He also hastened to add, while looking at the old black:  ""This very night Tom and I discovered his treason, and if he had not jumped on his horse and fled, I would have killed him"". ""So this farm--""  ""There is neither farm, nor village, nor settlement in the neighborhood,"" replied Dick Sand. ""Mrs. Weldon, I repeat to you, we must return to the coast"".

The brave negro gently took in his strong arms the little sleeping boy, who did not even wake. Their arms were carefully examined. What remained of the provisions was placed in one package, so as to be carried by one man. Austin threw it on his back, and his companions thus became free in their movements.

5012,"It would be imprudent to affirm it. Little disturbed him. Besides, he was under the effects of one of the most terrible catastrophes that could befall him. In fact, a grave complication, Cousin Benedict had lost his magnifying-glass and his spectacles. Very happily, also, but without his suspecting it, Bat had found the two precious articles in the tall grass where they had slept, but, by Dick Sand's advice, he kept them safely. By this means they would be sure that the big child would keep quiet during the march, because he could see no farther, as they say, than the end of his nose. Thus, placed between Acteon and Austin, with the formal injunction not to leave them, the woful Benedict uttered no complaint, but followed in his place, like a blind man led by a string.

5013,"""In fact, Dingo is not here""! replied Hercules. The black called the dog several times with his powerful voice. No barking replied to him. Dick Sand remained silent. The absence of the dog, was to be regretted, for he had preserved the little party from all surprise. ""Could Dingo have followed Harris""? asked Tom. ""Harris?

5015,"Already a storm was threatened in the air. Probably the day would not end without some thunder-claps. Happily the forest, more or less dense, retained a little freshness of the surface of the soil. Here and there great forest trees inclosed prairies covered with a tall, thick grass. In certain spots enormous trunks, already petrified, lay on the ground, indicating the presence of coal mines, which are frequently met with on the African continent. Then, in the clearings, where the green carpet was mingled with some sprigs of roses, the flowers were various in color, yellow and blue ginger plants, pale lobelias, red orchids, incessantly visited by the insects which fertilized them. The trees no longer formed impenetrable masses, but their nature was more varied. There were a kind of palm-tree, which gives an oil found only in Africa; cotton-trees forming thickets from eight to ten feet high, whose wood-stalks produce a cotton with long hairs, almost analogous to that of Fernambouc. From the copals there oozes, by the holes which certain insects make, an odorous gum, which runs along the ground and collects for the wants of the natives.

5016,"In several places, also, the perfume was agreeably mingled with the tine odor of vanilla, although they could not discover what tree exhaled it. This whole collection of trees and plants was perfectly green, although it was in the middle of the dry season, and only rare storms could water these luxuriant forests. It was then the time for fevers; but, as Livingstone has observed, they can be cured by leaving the place where they have been contracted. Dick Sand knew this remark of the great traveler, and he hoped that little Jack would not contradict it. He told it to Mrs. Weldon, after having observed that the periodical access had not returned as they feared, and that the child slept quietly in Hercules' arms. Thus they went forward carefully and rapidly. Sometimes they discovered traces where men or animals had recently passed. The twisted and broken branches of the brushwood and the thickets afforded an opportunity to walk with a more equal step. But the greater part of the time numerous obstacles, which they had to overcome, retarded the little party, to Dick Sand's great disappointment. There were twisted lianes that might justly be compared with the disordered rigging of a ship, certain vines similar to bent swords, whose blades were ornamented with long thorns, vegetable serpents, fifty or sixty feet long, which had the faculty of turning to prick the passer-by with their sharp spikes.",test,0,2,0,several places also perfume agreeably mingled tine odor vanilla although could discover tree exhaled whole collection trees plants perfectly green although middle dry season rare storms could water luxuriant forests time fevers observed cured leaving place contracted knew remark great traveler hoped little would contradict told observed periodical access returned feared child slept quietly arms went forward carefully rapidly discovered traces men animals recently passed twisted broken branches brushwood thickets afforded opportunity walk equal step greater part time numerous obstacles overcome retarded little party great disappointment twisted lianes might justly compared disordered rigging ship certain vines similar bent swords whose blades ornamented long thorns vegetable serpents fifty sixty feet long faculty turning prick passerby sharp spikes
5017,"The blacks, hatchet in hand, cut them down with vigorous blows, but the lianes reappeared constantly, reaching from the earth to the top of the highest trees which they encircled. The animal kingdom was not less curious than the vegetable kingdom in this part of the province. Birds flew in vast numbers under these powerful branches; but it will be understood that they had no gunshot to fear from the men, who wished to pass as secretly as rapidly. There were Guinea fowls in large flocks, heath-cocks of various kinds, very difficult to approach, and some of those birds which the Americans of the North have, by onomatopoeia, called ""whip-poor-wills,"" three syllables which exactly reproduce their cries. Dick Sand and Tom might truly have believed themselves in some province of the new continent. But, alas! they knew what to expect. Until then the deer, so dangerous in Africa, had not approached the little troop. They again saw, in this first halt, some giraffes, which Harris had undoubtedly called ostriches.

5018,"In the distance, on the edge of the prairie, there arose at times a thick cloud of dust. It was a herd of buffaloes, which galloped with the noise of wagons heavily laden. For two miles Dick Sand thus followed the course of the rivulet which must end in a more important river. He was in haste to confide his companions to the rapid current of one of the coast rivers. He felt sure that the dangers and the fatigue would be much less than on the shore. Towards noon three miles had been cleared without any bad incident or meeting. There was no trace of either Harris or Negoro. Dingo had not reappeared. It was necessary to halt to take rest and nourishment.

5019,"They talked very little during this repast. Mrs. Weldon had taken her little boy in her arms; she could not take her eyes off of him; she could not eat. ""You must take some nourishment, Mrs. Weldon,"" Dick Sand repeated several times. ""What will become of you if your strength gives out? Eat, eat! We will soon start again, and a good current will carry us without fatigue to the coast"". Mrs. Weldon looked in Dick Sand's face while he thus talked. The young novice's burning eyes spoke of the courage by which he felt animated.

THE BAD ROADS OF ANGOLA. At this moment little Jack awoke, and put his arms around his mother's neck. His eyes looked better. The fever had not returned.

""Yes, Dick, let us go,"" replied Mrs. Weldon. The camp was broken up, and the march continued again in the same order. It was necessary to pass through the underwood, so as not to leave the course of the rivulet. There had been some paths there, formerly, but those paths were dead, according to the native expression--that is, brambles and brushwood had usurped them. In these painful conditions they might spend three hours in making one mile. The blacks worked without relaxation.",test,0,1,0,shall soon arrive replied soon set said order cut short conversation let us go replied camp broken march continued order necessary pass underwood leave course rivulet paths formerly paths dead according native expressionthat brambles brushwood usurped painful conditions might spend three hours making one mile blacks worked without relaxation
5024,"Hercules, after putting little Jack back in Nan's arms, took his part of the work; and what a part! He gave stout ""heaves,"" making his ax turn round, and a hole was made before them, as if he had been a devouring fire. Fortunately, this fatiguing work would not last. This first mile cleared, they saw a large hole, opened through the underwood, which ended obliquely at the rivulet and followed its bank. It was a passage made by elephants, and those animals, doubtless by hundreds, were in the habit of traversing this part of the forest. Great holes, made by the feet of the enormous pachyderms, riddled a soil softened during the rainy season. Its spongy nature also prepared it for those large imprints. It soon appeared that this passage did not serve for those gigantic animals alone. Human beings had more than once taken this route, but as flocks, brutally led to the slaughter-house, would have followed it. Here and there bones of dead bodies strewed the ground; remains of skeletons, half gnawed by animals, some of which still bore the slave's fetters.",test,0,2,0,putting little back arms took part work part gave stout making ax turn round hole made devouring fire fatiguing work would last first mile cleared saw large hole opened underwood ended obliquely rivulet followed bank passage made elephants animals doubtless hundreds habit traversing part forest holes made feet enormous pachyderms riddled soil softened rainy season spongy nature also prepared large imprints soon appeared passage serve gigantic animals alone beings taken route flocks brutally led slaughterhouse would followed bones dead bodies strewed ground remains skeletons half gnawed animals still bore slaves fetters
5025,"There are, in Central Africa, long roads thus marked out by human débris. Hundreds of miles are traversed by caravans, and how many unhappy wretches fall by the way, under the agents' whips, killed by fatigue or privations, decimated by sickness! How many more massacred by the traders themselves, when food fails! Yes, when they can no longer feed them, they kill them with the gun, with the sword, with the knife! These massacres are not rare. So, then, caravans of slaves had followed this road. For a mile Dick Sand and his companions struck against these scattered bones at each step, putting to flight enormous fern-owls. Those owls rose at their approach, with a heavy flight, and turned round in the air. Mrs. Weldon looked without seeing. Dick Sand trembled lest she should question him, for he hoped to lead her back to the coast without telling her that Harris's treachery had led them astray in an African province.",test,0,2,0,long roads thus marked human débris miles traversed caravans many unhappy wretches fall way agents whips killed fatigue privations decimated sickness many massacred traders food fails longer feed kill gun sword knife massacres rare caravans slaves followed road mile companions struck scattered bones step putting flight enormous fernowls owls rose approach heavy flight turned round air looked without seeing trembled lest question hoped lead back coast without telling treachery led astray province
5026,"Fortunately, Mrs. Weldon did not explain to herself what she had under her eyes. She had desired to take her child again, and little Jack, asleep, absorbed all her care. Nan walked near her, and neither of them asked the young novice the terrible questions he dreaded. Old Tom went along with his eyes down. He understood only too well why this opening was strewn with human bones. His companions looked to the right, to the left, with an air of surprise, as if they were crossing an interminable cemetery, the tombs of which had been overthrown by a cataclysm; but they passed in silence. Meanwhile, the bed of the rivulet became deeper and wider at the same time. Its current was less impetuous. Dick Sand hoped that it would soon become navigable, or that it would before long reach a more important river, tributary to the Atlantic. Cost what it might, the young novice was determined to follow this stream of water.",test,0,1,2,explain eyes desired take child little asleep absorbed care walked near neither asked young novice terrible questions dreaded went along eyes understood well opening strewn human bones companions looked right left air surprise crossing interminable cemetery tombs overthrown cataclysm passed silence bed rivulet became deeper wider time current less impetuous hoped would soon become navigable would long reach important river tributary might young novice determined follow stream water
5027,"Neither did he hesitate to abandon this opening; because, as ending by an oblique line, it led away from the rivulet. The little party a second time ventured through the dense underwood. They marched, ax in hand, through leaves and bushes inextricably interlaced. But if this vegetation obstructed the ground, they were no longer in the thick forest that bordered the coast. Trees became rare. Large sheaves of bamboo alone rose above the grass, and so high that even Hercules was not a head over them. The passage of the little party was only revealed by the movement of these stalks. Toward three o'clock in the afternoon of that day, the nature of the ground totally changed. Here were long plains, which must have been entirely inundated in the rainy season.

5028,"Should it be diversified by any steep ascents, they would see brown hematites appear, the last deposits of some rich vein of mineral. Dick Sand then recalled--and very fortunately--what he had read in ""Livingstone's Travels"". More than once the daring doctor had nearly rested in these marshes, so treacherous under foot. ""Listen to me, my friends,"" said he, going ahead. ""Try the ground before stepping on it"". ""In fact,"" replied Tom, ""they say that these grounds have been softened by the rain; but, however, it has not rained during these last days"". ""No,"" replied Bat; ""but the storm is not far off"". ""The greater reason,"" replied Dick Sand, ""why we should hurry and get clear of this swamp before it commences.

5029,"You, Mr. Benedict--Why, what are you doing, Mr. Benedict""? ""I am falling""! innocently replied Cousin Benedict, who had just disappeared as if a trap had been suddenly opened beneath his feet. In fact, the poor man had ventured on a sort of quagmire, and had disappeared half-way in the sticky mud. They stretched out their hands, and he rose, covered with slime, but quite satisfied at not having injured his precious entomologist's box. Acteon went beside him, and made it his duty to preserve the unlucky, near-sighted man from any new disasters. Besides, Cousin Benedict had made rather a bad choice of the quagmire for his plunge. When they drew him out of the sticky earth a large quantity of bubbles rose to the surface, and, in bursting, they emitted some gases of a suffocating odor. Livingstone, who had been sunk up to his chest in this slime, compared these grounds to a collection of enormous sponges, made of black, porous earth, from which numerous streams of water spouted when they were stepped upon. These places were always very dangerous.",test,0,2,0,falling innocently replied disappeared trap suddenly opened beneath feet fact poor man ventured sort quagmire disappeared halfway sticky mud stretched hands rose covered slime quite satisfied injured precious entomologists box went beside made duty preserve unlucky nearsighted man new disasters made rather bad choice quagmire plunge drew sticky earth large quantity bubbles rose surface bursting emitted gases suffocating odor sunk chest slime compared grounds collection enormous sponges made black porous earth numerous streams water spouted stepped upon places always dangerous
5030,"For the space of half a mile Dick Sand and his companions must march over this spongy soil. It even became so bad that Mrs. Weldon was obliged to stop, for she sank deep in the mire. Hercules, Bat, and Austin, wishing to spare her the unpleasantness more than the fatigue of a passage across this marshy plain, made a litter of bamboos, on which she consented to sit. Her little Jack was placed in her arms, and they endeavored to cross that pestilential marsh in the quickest manner. The difficulties were great. Acteon held Cousin Benedict firmly. Tom aided Nan, who, without him, would have disappeared several times in some crevice. The three other blacks carried the litter. At the head, Dick Sand sounded the earth.

5031,"They marched from preference on the edges, which were covered by a thick and tough grass. Often the support failed, and they sank to the knees in the slime. At last, about five o'clock in the evening, the marsh being cleared, the soil regained sufficient firmness, thanks to its clayey nature; but they felt it damp underneath. Very evidently these lands lay below the neighboring rivers, and the water ran through their pores. At that time the heat had become overwhelming. It would even have been unbearable, if thick storm clouds had not interposed between the burning rays and the ground. Distant lightnings began to rend the sky and low rollings of thunder grumbled in the depths of the heavens. A formidable storm was going to burst forth. Now, these cataclysms are terrible in Africa: rain in torrents, squalls of wind which the strongest trees cannot resist, clap after clap of thunder, such is the contest of the elements in that latitude.

5032,"They could not pass the night without shelter. The plain was likely to be inundated, and it did not present a single elevation on which it was possible to seek refuge. But refuge, where would they seek it in this low desert, without a tree, without a bush? The bowels of the earth even would not give it. Two feet below the surface they would find water. However, toward the north a series of low hills seemed to limit the marshy plain. It was as the border of this depression of land. A few trees were profiled there on a more distant, clearer belt, left by the clouds on the line of the horizon. There, if shelter were still lacking, the little band would at least no longer risk being caught in a possible inundation.

The brave black would have wished to take that whole world in big arms and carry it alone. Those words inspired those courageous men, and in spite of the fatigue of a day's march, they advanced more quickly than they had done at the commencement from the halting-place.

5034,"Darkness then became almost complete, though the sun had not disappeared below the horizon. But the dome of vapors gradually lowered, as if it threatened to fall in--a falling in which must result in a torrent of rain. Lightnings, red or blue, split it in a thousand places, and enveloped the plain in an inextricable network of fire. Twenty times Dick and his companions ran the risk of being struck by lightning. On this plateau, deprived of trees, they formed the only projecting points which could attract the electrical discharges. Jack, awakened by the noise of the thunder, hid himself in Hercules' arms. He was very much afraid, poor little boy, but he did not wish to let his mother see it, for fear of afflicting her more. Hercules, while taking great steps, consoled him as well as he could.

What would become of Mrs. Weldon and her companions, if they did not find a shelter? Dick Sand stopped a moment near old Tom. ""What must be done""? said he.

Were they then shut up under their tents, so as to let the storm pass, or was the camp abandoned? In the first case, whatever Heaven should threaten, Dick Sand must flee in the quickest manner. In the second, there was, perhaps, the shelter he asked. ""I shall find out,"" he said to himself; then, addressing old Tom: ""Stay here. Let no one follow me.

The young novice left at once and disappeared in the darkness, which was profound when the lightning did not tear the sky. Some large drops of rain already began to fall.

""But then,"" replied Cousin Benedict, ""those would be ant-hills of the warlike termite or of the devouring termite. Only those ingenious insects raise such monuments, which the greatest architects would not disown"".

5041,"said Cousin Benedict again. ""I thought those ant-hills only existed in Africa"". ""Forward""! exclaimed Dick Sand, for the last time, with a sort of violence. He was so much afraid that Mrs. Weldon might hear the last word pronounced by the entomologist. They followed Dick Sand with all haste. A furious wind had sprung up. Large drops crackled on the ground. In a few moments the squalls of wind would become unbearable. Soon one of those cones which stood on the plain was reached.",test,0,4,0,said thought anthills existed exclaimed last time sort violence much afraid might hear last word pronounced entomologist followed haste furious wind sprung drops crackled ground moments squalls wind would become unbearable one cones stood plain reached
5042,"No matter how threatening the termites might be, the human beings must not hesitate. If they could not drive the insects away, they must share their abode. At the bottom of this cone, made with a kind of reddish clay, there was a very narrow hole. Hercules enlarged it with his cutlass in a few moments, so as to give a passage even to a man like himself. To Cousin Benedict's extreme surprise, not one of the thousands of termites that ought to occupy the ant-hill showed itself. Was, then, the cone abandoned?

5043,"It was one of those termite cones that, according to Lieutenant Cameron's comparison, are more astonishing than the pyramids of Egypt, raised by the hands of men, because they have been built by such small insects. ""It is,"" said he, ""as if a nation had built Mount Everest, the highest mountain of the Himalaya chain"". CHAPTER V.  ANTS AND THEIR DWELLING. At this moment the storm burst with a violence unknown in temperate latitudes. It was providential that Dick Sand and his companions had found this refuge! In fact, the rain did not fall in distinct drops, but in streams of various thickness. Sometimes it was a compact mass forming a sheet of water, like a cataract, a Niagara. Imagine an aerial basin, containing a whole sea, being upset. Under such showers the ground was hollowed out, the plains were changed to lakes, the streams to torrents, the rivers, overflowing, inundated vast territories. In temperate zones the violence of the storms decreases according to their duration; but in Africa, however heavy they are, they continue for several entire days.",test,0,2,0,one termite cones according comparison astonishing pyramids raised hands men built small insects said nation built highest mountain chain moment storm burst violence unknown temperate latitudes providential companions found refuge fact rain fall distinct drops streams various thickness compact mass forming sheet water like cataract aerial basin containing whole sea upset showers ground hollowed plains changed lakes streams torrents rivers overflowing inundated vast territories temperate zones violence storms decreases according duration however heavy continue several entire days
5044,"How can so much electricity be collected in the clouds? How can such quantities of vapor be accumulated? It is very difficult to comprehend this. However, such are the facts, and one might suppose himself transported to the extraordinary epochs of the diluvian period. Fortunately, the ant-cone, with its thick walls, was perfectly impervious. A beaver's hut, of well-beaten earth, could not have been more water-tight. A torrent could have passed over it without a single drop of water filtering through its pores. As soon as Dick Sand and his companions had taken possession of the cone they occupied themselves in examining its interior arrangement. The lantern was lighted, and the ant-hill was sufficiently illuminated. This cone, which measured twelve feet in height inside, was eleven feet wide, except in its upper part, which rounded in the form of a sugar loaf.",test,0,1,0,much electricity collected clouds quantities vapor accumulated difficult comprehend facts one might suppose transported extraordinary epochs diluvian period antcone thick walls perfectly impervious beavers hut wellbeaten earth could watertight torrent could passed without single drop water filtering pores soon companions taken possession cone occupied examining interior arrangement lantern lighted anthill sufficiently illuminated cone measured twelve feet height inside eleven feet wide except upper part rounded form sugar loaf
5045,"Everywhere the walls were about one foot in thickness, and there was a distance between the stories of cells which adorned them. We may be astonished at the construction of such monuments, due to these industrious swarms of insects, but it is true that they are frequently found in the interior of Africa. Smeathman, a Dutch traveler of the last century, with four of his companions, occupied the top of one of these cones. In the Lounde, Livingstone observed several of these ant-hills, built of reddish clay, and attaining a height of fifteen and twenty feet. Lieutenant Cameron has many a time mistaken for a camp these collections of cones which dotted the plain in N'yangwe. He has even stopped at the foot of great edifices, not more than twenty feet high, but composed of forty or fifty enormous rounded cones, flanked with bell-towers like the dome of a cathedral, such as Southern Africa possesses. To what species of ant was due, then, the prodigious style of architecture of these cones? ""To the warlike termite,"" Cousin Benedict had replied, without hesitating, as soon as he had recognized the nature of the materials employed in their construction. And, in fact, the walls, as has been said, were made of reddish clay. Had they been formed of a gray or black alluvian earth, they must have been attributed to the ""termes mordax"" or the ""termes atrox"".",test,0,2,0,walls one foot thickness distance stories cells adorned may astonished construction monuments due industrious swarms insects true frequently found interior traveler last century four companions occupied top one cones observed several anthills built reddish clay attaining height fifteen twenty feet many time mistaken camp collections cones dotted plain even stopped foot great edifices twenty feet high composed forty fifty enormous rounded cones flanked belltowers like dome cathedral possesses species ant due prodigious style architecture cones warlike termite replied without hesitating soon recognized nature materials employed construction fact walls said made reddish clay formed gray black alluvian earth must attributed mordax atrox
5046,"As we see, these insects have not very cheering names--a fact which cannot but please a strong entomologist, such as Cousin Benedict. The central part of the cone, in which the little troop had first found shelter, and which formed the empty interior, would not have contained them; but large cavities, in close contact, made a number of divisions, in which a person of medium height could find refuge. Imagine a succession of open drawers, and at the bottom of those drawers millions of cells which the termites had occupied, and the interior disposition of the ant-hill is easily understood. To sum up, these drawers are in tiers, like the berths in a ship's cabin. In the upper ones Mrs. Weldon, little Jack, Nan, and Cousin Benedict took refuge. In the lower row Austin, Bat, and Acteon hid themselves. As for Dick Sand, Tom, and Hercules, they remained in the lower part of the cone. ""My friends,"" then said the young novice to the two blacks, ""the ground is becoming damp.

This is the first time in ten days that we have not to sleep in the open air"". ""Ten days""! repeated Tom. ""Besides,"" added Dick Sand, ""as this cone forms a solid shelter, perhaps we had better stay here twenty-four hours. During that time, I will go in search of the stream that we are in need of; it cannot be very distant. I think that until we have constructed our raft, it will be better not to quit this shelter.

5048,"Dick Sand's orders were executed at once. Hercules, with his ax, crumbled the first story of cells, which was composed of crisp red clay. He thus raised, more than a foot, the interior part of the swampy earth on which the ant-hill rested, and Dick Sand made sure that the air could freely penetrate to the interior of the cone through the orifice pierced at its base. It was, certainly, a fortunate circumstance that the ant-hill had been abandoned by the termites. With a few thousands of these ants, it would have been uninhabitable. But, had it been evacuated for some time, or had the voracious newroptera but just quitted it? It was not superfluous to ponder this question. Cousin Benedict was so much surprised at the abandonment, that he at once considered the reason for it, and he was soon convinced that the emigration had been recent. In fact, he did not wait, but, descending to the lower part of the cone, and taking the lantern, he commenced to examine the most secret corners of the ant-hill. He thus discovered what is called the ""general store-house"" of the termites, that is to say, the place where these industrious insects lay up the provisions of the colony.",test,0,2,0,orders executed ax crumbled first story cells composed crisp red clay thus raised foot interior part swampy earth anthill rested made sure air could freely penetrate interior cone orifice pierced base certainly fortunate circumstance anthill abandoned termites thousands ants would uninhabitable evacuated time voracious newroptera quitted superfluous ponder question much surprised abandonment considered reason soon convinced emigration recent fact wait descending lower part cone taking lantern commenced examine secret corners anthill thus discovered called storehouse termites say place industrious insects lay provisions colony
5049,"It was a cavity hollowed in the wall, not far from the royal cell, which Hercules's labor had destroyed, along with the cells destined for the young larvae. In this store-room Cousin Benedict collected a certain quantity of particles of gum and the juices of plants, scarcely solidified, which proved that the termites had lately brought them from without. ""Well, no""! cried he. ""No""! as if he were replying to some contradiction, ""No, this ant-hill has not been long abandoned"". ""Who says to the contrary, Mr. Benedict""? said Dick Sand. ""Recently or not, the important thing for us is that the termites have left it, because we have to take their place"".

5050,"Yesterday--this morning, perhaps--these sagacious newroptera were still here, because, see these liquid juices; and this evening----""  ""Well, what do you conclude, Mr. Benedict""? asked Dick Sand. ""That a secret presentiment has caused them to abandon the cone. Not only have all the termites left their cells, but they have taken care to carry away the young larvae, of which I cannot find one. Well, I repeat that all this was not done without a motive, and that these sagacious insects foresaw some near danger"". ""They foresaw that we were going to invade their dwelling,"" replied Hercules, laughing. ""Indeed""! replied Cousin Benedict, whom this answer sensibly shocked. ""You think yourself so strong that you would be dangerous to these courageous insects?

5051,"""Dead, certainly,"" replied Hercules, who would not give up; ""but, living, I could crush masses of them"". ""You might crush a hundred thousand, five hundred thousand, a million,"" replied Cousin Benedict, with animation, ""but not a thousand millions; and a thousand millions would devour you, living or dead, to the last morsel"". During this discussion, which was less trifling than might be supposed, Dick Sand reflected on the observations made by Cousin Benedict. There was no doubt that the savant knew too much about the habits of the termites to be mistaken. If he declared that a secret instinct warned them to leave the ant-hill recently, it was because there was truly peril in remaining in it. Meanwhile, as it was impossible to abandon this shelter at a moment when the storm was raging with unparalleled intensity, Dick Sand looked no farther for an explanation of what seemed to be inexplicable, and he contented himself with saying:  ""Well, Mr. Benedict, if the termites have left their provisions in this ant-hill, we must not forget that we have brought ours, and let us have supper. To-morrow, when the storm will be over, we will consult together on our future plans"". They then occupied themselves in preparing the evening meal, for, great as their fatigue was, it had not affected the appetite of these vigorous walkers. On the contrary, the food, which had to last for two more days, was very welcome.

5052,"Between Hercules's jaws it was like grain under the miller's grindstone. It did not crackle, it powdered. Mrs. Weldon alone scarcely eat, and even Dick Sand's entreaties were vain. It seemed to him that this brave woman was more preoccupied, more sad than she had been hitherto. Meanwhile her little Jack suffered less; the fever had not returned, and at this time he was sleeping, under his mother's eyes, in a cell well lined with garments. Dick Sand knew not what to think. It is useless to say that Cousin Benedict did honor to the repast, not that he paid any attention either to the quality or to the quantity of the food that he devoured, but because he had found an opportunity to deliver a lecture in entomology on the termites. Ah! if he had been able to find a termite, a single one, in the deserted ant hill!

5053,"""These admirable insects,"" said he, without taking the trouble to find out if any one were listening--""these admirable insects belong to the marvelous order of newroptera, whose horns are longer than the head, the jaws very distinct, and whose lower wings are generally equal to the upper ones. Five tribes constitute this order: the Panorpates (scorpion flies), the Myrmileoniens, the Hemerobins, the Termitines and the Perlides. It is useless to add that the insects which now interest us, and whose dwelling we occupy, perhaps unduly, are the Termitines"". At this moment Dick Sand listened very attentively to Cousin Benedict. Had the meeting with these termites excited in him the thought that he was perhaps on the African continent, without knowing by what chance he had arrived there? The young novice was very anxious to find out. The savant, mounted on his favorite hobby, continued to ride it beautifully. ""Now these termitines,"" said he, ""are characterized by four joints on the instep, horned jaws, and remarkable strength. We have the _mantispe_ species, the _raphidie_, and the termite species.

5054,"asked Dick Sand. ""They are the martial ants,"" replied Cousin Benedict, who pronounced this word as if it had been the Macedonians, or some other ancient people brave in war. ""Yes, the warlike ants, and of all sizes. Between Hercules and a dwarf the difference would be less than between the largest of these insects and the smallest. Among them are 'workers' of five millimeters in length 'soldiers' of ten, and males and females of twenty. We find also a kind otherwise very curious: the _sirafous_ half an inch in length, which have pincers for jaws, and a head larger than the body, like the sharks. They are the sharks among insects, and in a fight between some _sirafous_ and a shark, I would bet on the _sirafous_"". ""And where are these _sirafous_ commonly observed""? then asked Dick Sand.

5055,"Africa is, in fact, the country of ants. You should read what Livingstone says of them in the last notes reported by Stanley. More fortunate than myself, the doctor has witnessed a Homeric battle, joined between an army of black ants and an army of red ants. The latter, which are called 'drivers,' and which the natives name _sirafous_, were victorious. ""The others, the '_tchoungous_,' took flight, carrying their eggs and their young, not without having bravely defended themselves. Never, according to Livingstone, never was the spirit of battle carried farther, either among men or beasts! With their tenacious jaws, which tear out the piece, these _sirafous_ make the bravest man recoil. The largest animals--even lions and elephants--flee before them.

5056,"Another African traveler--Du Chaillu--has seen a column of these ants defile past him for twelve hours without stopping on the road. But why be astonished at the sight of such myriads? The fecundity of these insects is surprising; and, to return to our fighting termites, it has been proved that a female deposits as much as sixty thousand eggs in a day!

""No, no""! replied Cousin Benedict; ""and, thus far, these warlike termites, and their villages of ant-hills, have only been observed on the African Continent. Ah! such travelers.

It was evident that the truth had not entered Cousin Benedict's brain. The poor man and all his companions, Dick Sand and Tom excepted, believed themselves, and must believe themselves, where they were not! It needed other incidents, facts still more grave than certain scientific curiosities, to undeceive them! It was then nine o'clock in the morning. Cousin Benedict had talked for a long time.

5059,"Dick Sand no longer questioned him, and remained motionless, although he did not sleep. As for Hercules, he had resisted longer than the others; but fatigue soon finished by shutting his eyes, and, with his eyes, his ears. For some time longer Cousin Benedict continued to lecture. However, sleep finally got the best of him, and he mounted to the upper cavity of the cone, in which he had chosen his domicile. Deep silence fell on the interior of the cone, while the storm filled space with noise and fire. Nothing seemed to indicate that the tempest was nearly over. The lantern had been extinguished. The interior of the ant-hill was plunged in complete darkness. No doubt all slept. However, Dick Sand, alone, did not seek in sleep the repose which was so necessary to him.",test,0,1,0,longer questioned remained motionless although sleep resisted longer others fatigue soon finished shutting eyes eyes ears time longer continued lecture sleep finally got best mounted upper cavity cone chosen domicile silence fell interior cone storm filled space noise fire seemed indicate tempest nearly lantern extinguished interior anthill plunged complete darkness doubt slept alone seek sleep repose necessary
5060,"Thought absorbed him. He dreamed of his companions, whom he would save at all hazards. The wrecking of the ""Pilgrim"" had not been the end of their cruel trials, and others, still more terrible, threatened them should they fall into the hands of these natives. And how to avoid this danger, the worst of all, during their return to the coast. Harris and Negoro had not led them a hundred miles into the interior of Angola without a secret design to gain possession of them. But what did this miserable Portuguese intend? Who had merited his hatred? The young novice repeated to himself, that he alone had incurred it. Then he passed in review all the incidents that had taken place during the ""Pilgrim's"" voyage; the meeting with the wreck and the blacks; the pursuit of the whale; the disappearance of Captain Hull and his crew. Dick Sand had found himself, at the age of fifteen, intrusted with the command of a vessel, the compass and log of which were soon injured by Negoro's criminal actions.",test,0,2,0,absorbed dreamed companions would save hazards wrecking end cruel trials others still terrible threatened fall hands natives avoid danger worst return coast led hundred miles interior without secret design gain possession miserable intend merited hatred young novice repeated alone incurred passed review incidents taken place voyage meeting wreck blacks pursuit whale disappearance crew found age fifteen intrusted command vessel compass log soon injured criminal actions
5061,"He again saw himself using his authority in the presence of this insolent cook, threatening to put him in irons, or to blow out his brains with a pistol shot. Ah, why had he hesitated to do it? Negoro's corpse would have been thrown overboard, and none of these catastrophes would have happened. Such were the young man's various thoughts. Then they dwelt a moment on the shipwreck which had ended the ""Pilgrim's"" voyage. The traitor Harris appeared then, and this province of South America gradually became transformed. Bolivia changed to the terrible Angola, with its feverish climate, its savage deer, its natives still more cruel. Could the little party escape during its return to the coast? This river which he was seeking, which he hoped to find, would it conduct them to the shore with more safety, and with less fatigue? He would not doubt it, for he knew well that a march of a hundred miles through this inhospitable country, in the midst of incessant dangers, was no longer possible.",test,0,2,0,saw using authority presence insolent cook threatening put irons blow brains pistol shot hesitated corpse would thrown overboard none catastrophes would happened young mans various thoughts dwelt moment shipwreck ended voyage traitor appeared province gradually became transformed changed terrible feverish climate savage deer natives still cruel little party escape return coast river seeking hoped find would conduct shore safety less fatigue would doubt knew well march hundred miles inhospitable country midst incessant dangers longer possible
5062,"""Happily,"" he said to himself, ""Mrs. Weldon and all are ignorant of the danger of the situation. Old Tom and I, we alone are to know that Negoro has thrown us on the coast of Africa; and that Harris has led me into the wilds of Angola"". Dick Sand was thus sunk in overpowering thoughts, when he felt a breath on his forehead. A hand rested on his shoulder, and a trembling voice murmured these words in his ear:  ""I know all, my poor Dick, but God can yet save us! His will be done""! CHAPTER VI. THE DIVING-BELL. To this unexpected revelation Dick Sand could not reply. Besides, Mrs. Weldon had gone back at once to her place beside little Jack.

5063,"Thus Mrs. Weldon knew what to believe. The various incidents, of the way had enlightened her also, and perhaps, too, that word, ""Africa""! so unluckily pronounced the night before by Cousin Benedict. ""Mrs. Weldon knows everything,"" repeated Dick Sand to himself. ""Well, perhaps it is better so. The brave woman does not despair. I shall not despair either"". Dick Sand now longed for day to return, that he might explore the surroundings of this termite village. He must find a tributary of the Atlantic with a rapid course to transport all his little troop.

5064,"Above all, they must avoid an encounter with the natives, perhaps already sent in pursuit of them under Harris's and Negoro's direction. But it was not day yet. No light made its way into the cone through the lower orifice. Rumblings, rendered low by the thickness of the walls, indicated that the storm still raged. Listening, Dick Sand also heard the rain falling with violence at the base of the ant-hill. As the large drops no longer struck a hard soil, he must conclude that the whole plain was inundated. It must have been about eleven o'clock. Dick Sand then felt that a kind of torpor, if not a true sleep, was going to overcome him. It would, however, be rest. But, just as he was yielding to it, the thought came to him that, by the settling of the clay, washed in, the lower orifice was likely to be obstructed.",test,0,1,0,must avoid encounter natives perhaps already sent pursuit direction day yet light made way cone lower orifice rendered low thickness walls indicated storm still raged also heard rain falling violence base anthill large drops longer struck hard soil must conclude whole plain inundated must eleven oclock felt kind torpor true sleep going overcome would however rest yielding thought came settling clay washed lower orifice likely obstructed
5065,"All passage for the outer air would be closed. Within, the respiration of ten persons would soon vitiate the air by loading it with carbonic acid. Dick Sand then slipped to the ground, which had been raised by the clay from the first floor of cells. That cushion was still perfectly dry, and the orifice entirely free. The air penetrated freely to the interior of the cone, and with it some flashes of lightning, and the loud noises of that storm, that a diluvian rain could not extinguish. Dick Sand saw that all was well. No immediate danger seemed to menace these human termites, substituted for the colony of newroptera. The young novice then thought of refreshing himself by a few hours' sleep, as he already felt its influence. Only with supreme precaution Dick Sand lay on that bed of clay, at the bottom of the cone, near the narrow edifice. By this means, if any accident happened outside, he would be the first to remark it.",test,0,1,0,passage outer air would closed respiration ten persons would soon vitiate air loading carbonic acid slipped ground raised clay first floor cells cushion still perfectly dry orifice entirely free air penetrated freely interior cone flashes lightning loud noises storm diluvian rain could extinguish saw well immediate danger seemed menace human termites substituted colony newroptera young novice thought refreshing hours sleep already felt influence supreme precaution lay bed clay bottom cone near narrow edifice means accident happened outside would first remark
5066,"The rising day would also awaken him, and he would be ready to begin the exploration of the plain. Dick Sand lay down then, his head against the wall, his gun under his hand, and almost immediately he was asleep. How long this drowsiness lasted he could not tell, when he was awakened by a lively sensation of coolness. He rose and recognized, not without great anxiety, that the water was invading the ant hill, and even so rapidly, that in a few seconds it would reach the story of cells occupied by Tom and Hercules. The latter, awakened by Dick Sand, were told about this new complication. The lighted lantern soon showed the interior of the cone. The water had stopped at a height of about five feet, and remained stationary. ""What is the matter, Dick""? asked Mrs. Weldon. ""It is nothing,"" replied the young novice.",test,0,1,0,rising day would also awaken would ready begin exploration plain lay head wall gun hand almost immediately asleep long drowsiness lasted could tell awakened lively sensation coolness rose recognized without great anxiety water invading ant hill even rapidly seconds would reach story cells occupied latter awakened told new complication lighted lantern soon showed interior cone water stopped height five feet remained stationary matter asked nothing replied young novice
5067,"""The lower part of the cone has been inundated. It is probably that during this storm a neighboring river has overflowed on this plain"". ""Good""! said Hercules; ""that proves the river is there""! ""Yes,"" replied Dick Sand, ""and it will carry us to the coast. Be reassured, then, Mrs. Weldon; the water cannot reach you, nor little Jack, nor Nan, nor Mr. Benedict"". Mrs. Weldon did not reply. As to the cousin, he slept like a veritable termite. Meanwhile the blacks, leaning over this sheet of water, which reflected the lantern's light, waited for Dick Sand to indicate to them what should be done. He was measuring the height of the inundation.",test,0,1,0,lower part cone inundated probably storm neighboring river overflowed plain said proves river replied carry us coast reassured water reach little reply cousin slept like veritable termite blacks leaning sheet water reflected lanterns light waited indicate done measuring height inundation
5068,"After having the provisions and arms put out of the reach of the inundation, Dick Sand was silent. ""The water has penetrated by the orifice,"" said Tom. ""Yes,"" replied Dick Sand, ""and now it prevents the interior air from being renewed"". ""Could we not make a hole in the wall above the level of the water""? asked the old black. ""Doubtless, Tom; but if we have five feet of water within, there are perhaps six or seven, even more, without"". ""You think, Mr. Dick--""? ""I think, Tom, that the water, rising inside the ant-hill, has compressed the air in the upper part, and that this air now makes an obstacle to prevent the water from rising higher. But if we pierce a hole in the wall by which the air would escape, either the water would still rise till it reached the outside level, or if it passed the hole, it would rise to that point where the compressed air would again keep it back.

5069,"""What must be done""? asked Tom. ""Reflect well before acting,"" replied Dick Sand. ""An imprudence might cost us our lives""! The young novice's observation was very true. In comparing the cone to a submerged bell, he was right. Only in that apparatus the air is constantly renewed by means of pumps. The divers breathe comfortably, and they suffer no other inconveniences than those resulting from a prolonged sojourn in a compressed atmosphere, no longer at a normal pressure. But here, beside those inconveniences, space was already reduced a third by the invasion of the water. As to the air, it would only be renewed if they put it in communication with the outer atmosphere by means of a hole.",test,0,1,0,must done asked well acting replied imprudence might cost us lives young novices observation true comparing cone submerged bell right apparatus air constantly renewed means pumps divers breathe comfortably suffer inconveniences resulting prolonged sojourn compressed atmosphere longer normal pressure beside inconveniences space already reduced third invasion water air would renewed put communication outer atmosphere means hole
5070,"Could they, without running the danger spoken of by Dick Sand, pierce that hole? Would not the situation be aggravated by it? What was certain was, that the water now rested at a level which only two causes could make it exceed, namely: if they pierced a hole, and the level of the rising waters was higher outside, or if the height of this rising water should still increase. In either of these cases, only a narrow space would remain inside the cone, where the air, not renewed, would be still more compressed. But might not the ant-hill be torn from the ground and overthrown by the inundation, to the extreme danger of those within it? No, no more than a beaver's hut, so firmly did it adhere by its base. Then, the event most to be feared was the persistence of the storm, and, consequently, the increase of the inundation. Thirty feet of water on the plain would cover the cone with eighteen feet of water, and bear on the air within with the pressure of an atmosphere. Now, after reflecting well upon it, Dick Sand was led to fear that this inundation might increase considerably. In fact, it could not be due solely to that deluge poured out by the clouds.",test,0,2,0,without running danger spoken pierce hole situation aggravated certain water rested level two causes could make exceed namely pierced hole level rising waters higher outside height rising water still increase either cases narrow space would remain inside cone air renewed would still compressed might anthill torn ground overthrown inundation extreme danger within beavers hut firmly adhere base event feared persistence storm consequently increase inundation feet water plain would cover cone eighteen feet water bear air within pressure atmosphere reflecting well upon led fear inundation might increase considerably fact could due solely deluge poured clouds
5071,"It seemed more probable that a neighboring watercourse, swelled by the storm, had burst its banks, and was spreading over this plain lying below it. What proof had they that the ant-hill was not then entirely submerged, and that it was full time to leave it by the top part, which would not be difficult to demolish? Dick Sand, now extremely anxious, asked himself what he ought to do. Must he wait or suddenly announce the probable result of the situation, after ascertaining the condition of things? It was then three o'clock in the morning. All, motionless, silent, listened. The noise from outside came very feebly through the obstructed orifice. All the time a dull sound, strong and continued, well indicated that the contest of the elements had not ceased. At that moment old Tom observed that the water level was gradually rising. ""Yes,"" replied Dick Sand, ""and if it rises, as the air cannot escape from within, it is because the rising of the waters increases and presses it more and more"".",test,0,1,0,seemed probable neighboring watercourse swelled storm burst banks spreading plain lying proof anthill entirely submerged full time leave top part would difficult demolish extremely anxious asked ought wait suddenly announce probable result situation ascertaining condition things three oclock morning motionless silent listened noise outside came feebly obstructed orifice time dull sound strong continued well indicated contest elements ceased moment old observed water level gradually rising replied rises air escape within rising waters increases presses
5072,"""It is but slight so far,"" said Tom. ""Without doubt,"" replied Dick Sand; ""but where will this level stop""? ""Mr. Dick,"" asked Bat, ""would you like me to go out of the ant-hill? By diving, I should try to slip out by the hole"". ""It will be better for me to try it,"" replied Dick Sand. ""No, Mr. Dick, no,"" replied old Tom, quickly; ""let my son do it, and trust to his skill. In case he could not return, your presence is necessary here"". Then, lower:  ""Do not forget Mrs. Weldon and little Jack"". ""Be it so,"" replied Dick Sand. ""Go, then, Bat.",test,0,4,1,slight far said doubt replied level stop asked like go anthill diving try slip hole better try replied replied old quickly son trust skill case could return presence necessary lower forget little replied
5073,"If the ant-hill is submerged, do not seek to enter it again. We shall try to come out as you will have done. But if the cone still emerges, strike on its top with the ax that you will take with you. We will hear you, and it will be the signal for us to demolish the top from our side. You understand""? ""Yes, Mr. Dick,"" replied Bat. ""Go, then, boy,"" added old Tom, pressing his son's hand. Bat, after laying in a good provision of air by a long aspiration, plunged under the liquid mass, whose depth then exceeded five feet. It was a rather difficult task, because he would have to seek the lower orifice, slip through it, and then rise to the outside surface of the waters. That must be done quickly.",test,0,1,1,anthill submerged seek enter shall try come done cone still emerges strike top ax take hear signal us demolish top side understand replied boy added old pressing sons hand laying good provision air long aspiration plunged liquid mass whose depth exceeded five feet rather difficult task would seek lower orifice slip rise outside surface waters must done quickly
5074,"Nearly half a minute passed away. Dick Sand then thought that Bat had succeeded in passing outside when the black emerged. ""Well""! exclaimed Dick Sand. ""The hole is stopped up by rubbish""! replied Bat, as soon as he could take breath. ""Stopped up""! repeated Tom. ""Yes,"" replied Bat. ""The water has probably diluted the clay.",test,0,4,1,half minute passed away thought succeeded passing outside black emerged exclaimed hole stopped rubbish replied soon could take breath repeated replied water probably diluted clay
5075,"I have felt around the walls with my hand. There is no longer any hole"". Dick Sand shook his head. His companions and he were hermetically sequestered in this cone, perhaps submerged by the water. ""If there is no longer any hole,"" then said Hercules, ""we must make one"". ""Wait,"" replied the young novice, stopping Hercules, who, hatchet in hand, was preparing to dive. Dick Sand reflected for a few moments, and then he said:  ""We are going to proceed in another manner. The whole question is to know whether the water covers the ant-hill or not. If we make a small opening at the summit of the cone, we shall find out which it is. But in case the ant-hill should be submerged now, the water would fill it entirely, and we would be lost.",test,0,1,0,felt around walls hand longer hole shook head companions hermetically sequestered cone perhaps submerged water longer hole said must make one replied young novice stopping hatchet hand preparing dive reflected moments said going proceed another manner whole question know whether water covers anthill make small opening summit cone shall find case anthill submerged water would fill entirely would lost
5076,"Let us feel our way"". ""But quickly,"" replied Tom. In fact, the level continued to rise gradually. There were then six feet of water inside the cone. With the exception of Mrs. Weldon, her son, Cousin Benedict, and Nan, who had taken refuge in the upper cavities, all were immersed to the waist. Then there was a necessity for quick action, as Dick Sand proposed. It was one foot above the interior level, consequently seven feet from the ground, that Dick Sand resolved to pierce a hole in the clay wall. If, by this hole, they were in communication with the outer air, the cone emerges. If, on the contrary, this hole was pierced below the water level outside, the air would be driven inward, and in that case they must stop it up at once, or the water would rise to its orifice. Then they would commence again a foot higher, and so on.",test,0,1,0,us feel way quickly replied fact level continued rise gradually six feet water inside cone exception son taken refuge upper cavities immersed waist necessity quick action proposed one foot interior level consequently seven feet ground resolved pierce hole clay wall hole communication outer air cone emerges contrary hole pierced water level outside air would driven inward case must stop water would rise orifice would commence foot higher
5077,"If, at last, at the top, they did not yet find the outer air, it was because there was a depth of more than fifteen feet of water in the plain, and that the whole termite village had disappeared under the inundation. Then what chance had the prisoners in the ant-hill to escape the most terrible of deaths, death by slow asphyxia? Dick Sand knew all that, but he did not lose his presence of mind for a moment. He had closely calculated the consequences of the experiment he wished to try. Besides, to wait longer was not possible. Asphyxia was threatening in this narrow space, reduced every moment, in a medium already saturated with carbonic acid. The best tool Dick Sand could employ to pierce a hole through the wall was a ramrod furnished with a screw, intended to draw the wadding from a gun. By making it turn rapidly, this screw scooped out the clay like an auger, and the hole was made little by little. Then it would not have a larger diameter than that of the ramrod, but that would be sufficient. The air could come through very well.",test,0,2,0,last top yet find outer air depth fifteen feet water plain whole termite village disappeared inundation chance prisoners anthill escape terrible deaths death slow asphyxia knew lose presence mind moment closely calculated consequences experiment wished try wait longer possible threatening narrow space reduced every moment medium already saturated carbonic acid best tool could employ pierce hole wall ramrod furnished screw intended draw wadding gun making turn rapidly screw scooped clay like auger hole made little little would larger diameter ramrod would sufficient air could come well
5078,"Hercules holding up the lantern lighted Dick Sand. They had some wax candles to take its place, and they had not to fear lack of light from that source. A minute after the beginning of the operation, the ramrod went freely through the wall. At once a rather dull noise was produced, resembling that made by globules of air escaping through a column of water. The air escaped, and, at the same moment, the level of the water rose in the cone, and stopped at the height of the hole. This proved that they had pierced too low--that is to say, below the liquid mass. ""Begin again,"" the young novice said, coolly, after rapidly stopping the hole with a handful of clay. The water was again stationary in the cone, but the reserved space had diminished more than eight inches. Respiration became difficult, for the oxygen was beginning to fail. They saw it also by the lantern's light, which reddened and lost a part of its brightness.",test,0,2,0,holding lantern lighted wax candles take place fear lack light source minute beginning operation ramrod went freely wall rather dull noise produced resembling made globules air escaping column water air escaped moment level water rose cone stopped height hole proved pierced lowthat say liquid mass young novice said coolly rapidly stopping hole handful clay water stationary cone reserved space diminished eight inches became difficult oxygen beginning fail saw also lanterns light reddened lost part brightness
5079,"One foot above the first hole, Dick Sand began at once to pierce a second by the same process. If the experiment failed, the water would rise still higher inside the cone--but that risk must be run. While Dick Sand was working his auger, they heard Cousin Benedict cry out, suddenly:  ""Mercy! look--look--look why""! Hercules raised his lantern and threw its light on Cousin Benedict, whose face expressed the most perfect satisfaction. ""Yes,"" repeated he, ""look why those intelligent termites have abandoned the ant-hill! They had felt the inundation beforehand. Ah! instinct, my friends, instinct. The termites are wiser than we are, much wiser"".",test,0,1,1,foot first hole began pierce second process experiment failed water would rise still higher inside conebut risk must run working auger heard cry suddenly looklooklook raised lantern threw light whose face expressed perfect satisfaction repeated intelligent termites abandoned anthill felt inundation beforehand instinct friends instinct termites wiser much wiser
5080,"And that was all the moral Cousin Benedict drew from the situation. At that moment Dick Sand drew out the ramrod, which had penetrated the wall. A hissing was produced. The water rose another foot inside the cone--the hole had not reached the open air outside. The situation was dreadful. Mrs. Weldon, then almost reached by the water, had raised little Jack in her arms. All were stifling in this narrow space. Their ears buzzed. The lantern only threw a faint light.

5081,"murmured Dick Sand. He must know; and, in order to know, he must pierce a third hole, at the very top. But it was asphyxia, it was immediate death, if the result of this last attempt should prove fruitless. The air remaining inside would escape through the upper sheet of water, and the water would fill the whole cone. ""Mrs. Weldon,"" then said Dick Sand, ""you know the situation. If we delay, respirable air will fail us. If the third attempt fails, water will fill all this space. Our only chance is that the summit of the cone is above the level of the inundation. We must try this last experiment.

5082,"""Do it, Dick""! replied Mrs. Weldon. At that moment the lantern went out in that medium already unfit for combustion. Mrs. Weldon and her companions were plunged in the most complete darkness. Dick Sand was perched on Hercules's shoulders. The latter was hanging on to one of the lateral cavities. Only his head was above the bed of water. Mrs. Weldon, Jack, and Cousin Benedict were in the last story of cells. Dick Sand scratched the wall, and his ramrod pierced the clay rapidly. In this place the wall, being thicker and harder also, was more difficult to penetrate.",test,0,4,0,replied moment lantern went medium already unfit combustion companions plunged complete darkness perched shoulders latter hanging one lateral cavities head bed water last story cells scratched wall ramrod pierced clay rapidly place wall thicker harder also difficult penetrate
5083,"Dick Sand hastened, not without terrible anxiety, for by this narrow opening either life was going to penetrate with the air, or with the water it was death. Suddenly a sharp hissing was heard. The compressed air escaped--but a ray of daylight filtered through the wall. The water only rose eight inches, and stopped, without Dick Sand being obliged to close the hole. The equilibrium was established between the level within and that outside. The summit of the cone emerged. Mrs. Weldon and her companions were saved. At once, after a frantic hurra, in which Hercules's thundering voice prevailed, the cutlasses were put to work. The summit, quickly attacked, gradually crumbled. The hole was enlarged, the pure air entered in waves, and with it the first rays of the rising sun.",test,0,1,0,hastened without terrible anxiety narrow opening either life going penetrate air water death sharp hissing heard compressed air escapedbut ray daylight filtered wall water rose eight inches stopped without obliged close hole equilibrium established level within outside summit cone emerged companions saved frantic hurra thundering voice prevailed cutlasses put work summit quickly attacked gradually crumbled hole enlarged pure air entered waves first rays rising sun
5084,"The top once taken off the cone, it would be easy to hoist themselves on to its wall, and they would devise means of reaching some neighboring height, above all inundations. Dick Sand first mounted to the summit of the cone. A cry escaped him. That particular noise, too well known by African travelers, the whizzing of arrows, passed through the air. Dick Sand had had time to perceive a camp a hundred feet from the ant-hill, and ten feet from the cone, on the inundated plain, long boats, filled with natives. It was from one of those boats that the flight of arrows had come the moment the young novice's head appeared out of the hole. Dick Sand, in a word, had told all to his companions. Seizing his gun, followed by Hercules, Acteon, and Bat, he reappeared at the summit of the cone, and all fired on one of the boats. Several natives fell, and yells, accompanied by shots, replied to the detonation of the fire-arms. But what could Dick Sand and his companions do against a hundred Africans, who surrounded them on all sides?",test,0,2,0,top taken cone would easy hoist wall would devise means reaching neighboring height inundations first mounted summit cone cry escaped particular noise well known travelers whizzing arrows passed air time perceive camp hundred feet anthill ten feet cone inundated plain long boats filled natives one boats flight arrows come moment young novices head appeared hole word told companions gun followed reappeared summit cone fired one boats natives fell yells accompanied shots replied detonation firearms could companions hundred surrounded sides
5085,"The ant-hill was assailed. Mrs. Weldon, her child, and Cousin Benedict, all were brutally snatched from it, and without having had time to speak to each other or to shake hands for the last time, they saw themselves separated from each other, doubtless in virtue of orders previously given. A last boat took away Mrs. Weldon, little Jack and Cousin Benedict. Dick Sand saw them disappear in the middle of the camp. As to him, accompanied by Nan, Old Tom, Hercules, Bat, Acteon and Austin, he was thrown into a second boat, which went toward another point of the hill. Twenty natives entered this boat. It was followed by five others. Resistance was not possible, and nevertheless, Dick Sand and his companions attempted it. Some soldiers of the caravan were wounded by them, and certainly they would have paid for this resistance with their lives, if there had not been a formal order to spare them. In a few minutes, the passage was made.",test,0,1,0,anthill assailed child brutally snatched without time speak shake hands last time saw separated doubtless virtue orders previously given last boat took away little saw disappear middle camp accompanied thrown second boat went toward another point hill natives entered boat followed five others possible nevertheless companions attempted soldiers caravan wounded certainly would paid resistance lives formal order spare minutes passage made
5086,"But just as the boat landed, Hercules, with an irresistible bound, sprang on the ground. Two natives having sprung on him, the giant turned his gun like a club, and the natives fell, with their skulls broken. A moment after, Hercules disappeared under the cover of the trees, in the midst of a shower of balls, as Dick Sand and his companions, having been put on land, were chained like slaves. CHAPTER VII. IN CAMP ON THE BANKS OF THE COANZA. The aspect of the country was entirely changed since the inundation. It had made a lake of the plain where the termite village stood. The cones of twenty ant-hills emerged, and formed the only projecting points on this large basin. The Coanza had overflowed during the night, with the waters of its tributaries swelled by the storm. This Coanza, one of the rivers of Angola, flows into the Atlantic, a hundred miles from the cape where the ""Pilgrim"" was wrecked.",test,0,2,0,boat landed irresistible bound sprang ground natives sprung giant turned gun like club natives fell skulls broken moment disappeared cover trees midst shower balls companions put land chained like slaves aspect country entirely changed since inundation made lake plain termite village stood cones twenty anthills emerged formed projecting points large basin overflowed night waters tributaries swelled storm one rivers flows hundred miles cape wrecked
5087,"It was this river that Lieutenant Cameron had to cross some years later, before reaching Benguela. The Coanza is intended to become the vehicle for the interior transit of this portion of the Portuguese colony. Already steamers ascend its lower course, and before ten years elapse, they will ply over its upper bed. Dick Sand had then acted wisely in seeking some navigable river toward the north. The rivulet he had followed had just been emptied into the Coanza. Only for this sudden attack, of which he had had no intimation to put him on his guard, he would have found the Coanza a mile farther on. His companions and he would have embarked on a raft, easily constructed, and they would have had a good chance to descend the stream to the Portuguese villages, where the steamers come into port. There, their safety would be secured. It would not be so. The camp, perceived by Dick Sand, was established on an elevation near the ant-hill, into which fate had thrown him, as in a trap.",test,0,2,0,river cross years later reaching intended become vehicle interior transit portion colony steamers ascend lower course ten years elapse ply upper bed acted wisely seeking navigable river toward north rivulet followed emptied sudden attack intimation put guard would found mile farther companions would embarked raft easily constructed would good chance descend stream villages steamers come port safety would secured would camp perceived established elevation near anthill fate thrown trap
5088,"At the summit of that elevation rose an enormous sycamore fig-tree, which would easily shelter five hundred men under its immense branches. Those who have not seen those giant trees of Central Africa, can form no idea of them. Their branches form a forest, and one could be lost in it. Farther on, great banyans, of the kind whose seeds do not change into fruits, completed the outline of this vast landscape. It was under the sycamore's shelter, hidden, as in a mysterious asylum, that a whole caravan--the one whose arrival Harris had announced to Negoro--had just halted. This numerous procession of natives, snatched from their villages by the trader Alvez's agents, were going to the Kazounde market. Thence the slaves, as needed, would be sent either to the barracks of the west coast, or to N'yangwe, toward the great lake region, to be distributed either in upper Egypt, or in the factories of Zanzibar. As soon as they arrived at the camp, Dick Sand and his companions had been treated as slaves. Old Tom, his son Austin, Acteon, poor Nan, negroes by birth, though they did not belong to the African race, were treated like captive natives. After they were disarmed, in spite of the strongest resistance, they were held by the throat, two by two, by means of a pole six or seven feet long, forked at each end, and closed by an iron rod.",test,0,2,0,summit elevation rose enormous sycamore figtree would easily shelter five hundred men immense branches seen giant trees form idea branches form forest one could lost great banyans kind whose seeds change fruits completed outline vast landscape sycamores shelter hidden mysterious asylum whole caravanthe one whose arrival announced halted numerous procession natives snatched villages trader agents going market slaves needed would sent either barracks west coast toward great lake region distributed either upper factories soon arrived camp companions treated slaves son poor negroes birth though belong race treated like captive natives disarmed spite strongest resistance held throat two two means pole six seven feet long forked end closed iron rod
5089,"By this means they were forced to march in line, one behind the other, unable to get away either to the right or to the left. As an over precaution, a heavy chain was attached to their waists. They had their arms free, to carry burdens, their feet free to march, but they could not use them to flee. Thus they were going to travel hundreds of miles under an overseer's lash. Placed apart, overcome by the reaction which followed the first moments of their struggle against the negroes, they no longer made a movement. Why had they not been able to follow Hercules in his flight? And, meanwhile, what could they hope for the fugitive? Strong as he was, what would become of him in that inhospitable country, where hunger, solitude, savage beasts, natives, all were against him? Would he not soon regret his companion's fate? They, however, had no pity to expect from the chiefs of the caravan, Arabs or Portuguese, speaking a language they could not understand.",test,0,2,0,means forced march line one behind unable get away either right left precaution heavy chain attached waists arms free carry burdens feet free march could use flee going travel hundreds miles overseers lash apart overcome reaction followed first moments struggle negroes longer made movement able follow flight meanwhile could hope fugitive would become inhospitable country hunger solitude savage beasts natives soon regret companions fate however pity expect chiefs caravan speaking language could understand
5090,"These chiefs only entered into communication with their prisoners by menacing looks and gestures. Dick Sand himself was not coupled with any other slave. He was a white man, and probably they had not dared to inflict the common treatment on him. Unarmed, he had his feet and hands free, but a driver watched him especially. He observed the camp, expecting each moment to see Negoro or Harris appear. His expectation was in vain. He had no doubt, however, that those two miserable men had directed the attack against the ant-hill. Thus the thought came to him that Mrs. Weldon, little Jack, and Cousin Benedict had been led away separately by orders from the American or from the Portuguese. Seeing neither one nor the other, he said to himself that perhaps the two accomplices even accompanied their victims. Where were they leading them?",test,0,1,0,chiefs entered communication prisoners menacing looks gestures coupled slave white man probably dared inflict common treatment feet hands free driver watched especially observed camp expecting moment see appear expectation vain doubt however two miserable men directed attack anthill thought came little led away separately orders neither one said perhaps two accomplices even accompanied victims leading
5091,"What would they do with them? It was his most cruel care. Dick Sand forgot his own situation to think only of Mrs. Weldon and hers. The caravan, camped under the gigantic sycamore, did not count less than eight hundred persons, say five hundred slaves of both sexes, two hundred soldiers, porters, marauders, guards, drivers, agents, or chiefs. These chiefs were of Arab and Portugese origin. It would be difficult to imagine the cruelties that these inhuman beings inflicted on their captives. They struck them without relaxation, and those who fell exhausted, not fit to be sold, were finished with gunshots or the knife. Thus they hold them by terror. But the result of this system is, that on the arrival of the caravan, fifty out of a hundred slaves are missing from the trader's list. A few may have escaped, but the bones of those who died from torture mark out the long routes from the interior to the coast.",test,0,1,0,would cruel care forgot situation think caravan camped gigantic sycamore count less eight hundred persons say five hundred slaves sexes two hundred soldiers porters marauders guards drivers agents chiefs chiefs origin would difficult imagine cruelties inhuman beings inflicted captives struck without relaxation fell exhausted fit sold finished gunshots knife hold terror result system arrival caravan fifty hundred slaves missing traders list may escaped bones died torture mark long routes interior coast
5092,"It is supposed that the agents of European origin, Portuguese for the most part, are only rascals whom their country has rejected, convicts, escaped prisoners, old slave-drivers whom the authorities have been unable to hang--in a word, the refuse of humanity. Such was Negoro, such was Harris, now in the service of one of the greatest contractors of Central Africa, Jose-Antonio Alvez, well known by the traders of the province, about whom Lieutenant Cameron has given some curious information. The soldiers who escort the captives are generally natives in the pay of the traders. But the latter have not the monopoly of those raids which procure the slaves for them. The negro kings also make atrocious wars with each other, and with the same object. Then the vanquished adults, the women and children, reduced to slavery, are sold by the vanquishers for a few yards of calico, some powder, a few firearms, pink or red pearls, and often even, as Livingstone says, in periods of famine, for a few grains of maize. The soldiers who escorted old Alvez's caravan might give a true idea of what African armies are. It was an assemblage of negro bandits, hardly clothed, who brandished long flint-lock guns, the gun-barrels garnished with a great number of copper rings. With such an escort, to which are joined marauders who are no better, the agents often have all they can do. They dispute orders, they insist on their own halting places and hours, they threaten to desert, and it is not rare for the agents to be forced to yield to the exactions of this soldiery.",test,0,3,0,supposed agents origin part rascals country rejected convicts escaped prisoners old slavedrivers authorities unable hangin word refuse humanity service one greatest contractors well known traders province given curious information soldiers escort captives generally natives pay traders latter monopoly raids procure slaves negro kings also make atrocious wars object vanquished adults women children reduced slavery sold vanquishers yards calico powder firearms pink red pearls often even says periods famine grains maize soldiers escorted old caravan might give true idea armies assemblage negro bandits hardly clothed brandished long flintlock guns gunbarrels garnished great number copper rings escort joined marauders better agents often dispute orders insist halting places hours threaten desert rare agents forced yield exactions soldiery
5093,"Though the slaves, men or women, are generally subjected to carry burdens while the caravan is on the march, yet a certain number of porters accompany it. They are called more particularly ""Pagazis,"" and they carry bundles of precious objects, principally ivory. Such is the size of these elephants' teeth sometimes, of which some weigh as much as one hundred and sixty pounds, that it takes two of these ""Pagazis"" to carry them to the factories. Thence this precious merchandise is exported to the markets of Khartoum, of Zanzibar and Natal. On arriving, these ""Pagazis"" are paid the price agreed upon. It consists in twenty yards of cotton cloth, or of that stuff which bears the name of ""Merikani,"" a little powder, a handful of cowry (shells very common in that country, which serve as money), a few pearls, or even those of the slaves who would be difficult to sell. The slaves are paid, when the trader has no other money. Among the five hundred slaves that the caravan counted, there were few grown men. That is because, the ""Razzia"" being finished and the village set on fire, every native above forty is unmercifully massacred and hung to a neighboring tree. Only the young adults of both sexes and the children are intended to furnish the markets.",test,0,2,0,slaves men women generally subjected carry burdens caravan march yet certain number porters accompany called particularly carry bundles precious objects principally ivory size elephants teeth sometimes weigh much one hundred sixty pounds takes two carry factories precious merchandise exported markets arriving paid price agreed upon consists twenty yards cotton cloth stuff bears name little powder handful cowry common country serve money pearls even slaves would difficult sell slaves paid trader money five hundred slaves caravan counted grown men finished village set fire every native forty unmercifully massacred hung neighboring tree young adults sexes children intended furnish markets
5094,"After these men-hunts, hardly a tenth of the vanquished survive. This explains the frightful depopulation which changes vast territories of equatorial Africa into deserts. Here, the children and the adults were hardly clothed with a rag of that bark stuff, produced by certain trees, and called ""mbouzon"" in the country. Thus the state of this troop of human beings, women covered with wounds from the ""havildars'"" whips, children ghastly and meager, with bleeding feet, whom their mothers tried to carry in addition to their burdens, young men closely riveted to the fork, more torturing than the convict's chain, is the most lamentable that can be imagined. Yes, the sight of the miserable people, hardly living, whose voices have no sound, ebony skeletons according to Livingstone's expression, would touch the hearts of wild beasts. But so much misery did not touch those hardened Arabs nor those Portuguese, who, according to Lieutenant Cameron, are still more cruel. This is what Cameron says: ""To obtain these fifty women, of whom Alvez called himself proprietor, ten villages had been destroyed, ten villages having each from one hundred to two hundred souls: a total of fifteen hundred inhabitants. Some had been able to escape, but the greater part--almost all--had perished in the flames, had been killed in defending their families, or had died of hunger in the jungle, unless the beasts of prey had terminated their sufferings more promptly. ""Those crimes, perpetrated in the center of Africa by men who boast of the name of Christians, and consider themselves Portuguese, would seem incredible to the inhabitants of civilized countries.

5095,"_--Tour of the World_. In Portugal there have been very warm protestations against these assertions of Cameron's. It need not be said that, during the marches, as during the halts, the prisoners were very carefully guarded. Thus, Dick Sand soon understood that he must not even attempt to get away. But then, how find Mrs. Weldon again? That she and her child had been carried away by Negoro was only too certain. The Portuguese had separated her from her companions for reasons unknown as yet to the young novice. But he could not doubt Negoro's intervention, and his heart was breaking at the thought of the dangers of all kinds which threatened Mrs. Weldon. ""Ah""! he said to himself, ""when I think that I have held those two miserable men, both of them, at the end of my gun, and that I have not killed them""!",test,0,1,2,warm protestations assertions need said marches halts prisoners carefully guarded soon understood must even attempt get away find child carried away certain separated companions reasons unknown yet young novice could doubt intervention heart breaking thought dangers kinds threatened said think held two miserable men end gun killed
5096,"This thought was one of those which returned most persistently to Dick Sand's mind. What misfortunes the death, the just death of Harris and Negoro might have prevented! What misery, at least, for those whom these brokers in human flesh were now treating as slaves! All the horror of Mrs. Weldon's and little Jack's situation now represented itself to Dick Sand. Neither the mother nor the child could count on Cousin Benedict. The poor man could hardly take care of himself. Doubtless they were taking all three to some district remote from the province of Angola. But who was carrying the still sick child? ""His mother; yes, his mother,"" Dick Sand repeated to himself. ""She will have recovered strength for him; she will have done what these unhappy female slaves do, and she will fall like them.",test,0,1,0,thought one returned persistently mind misfortunes death death might prevented misery least brokers human flesh treating slaves horror little situation represented mother child could count poor man could hardly take care taking three district remote province carrying still sick child mother yes mother repeated recovered strength done unhappy female slaves fall like
5097,"Ah! may God put me again in front of her executioners, and I--""  But he was a prisoner! He counted one head in this live-stock that the overseers were driving to the interior of Africa. He did not even know whether Negoro and Harris themselves were directing the convoy of which their victims made a part. Dingo was no longer there to scent the Portuguese, to announce his approach.

5098,"All that a human being could do, Hercules would do in Mrs. Weldon's interest. Yes, either Hercules would try to find them and put himself in communication with them; or if that failed him, he would endeavor to concert with him, Dick Sand, and perhaps carry him off, deliver him by force. During the night halts, mingling with these prisoners, black like them, could he not deceive the soldier's vigilance, reach him, break his bonds, and lead him away into the forest? And both of them, then free, what would they not do for Mrs. Weldon's safety. A water course would enable them to descend to the coast. Dick Sand would again take up that plan so unfortunately prevented by the natives' attack, with new chances of success and a greater knowledge of the difficulties. The young novice thus alternated between fear and hope. In fact, he resisted despair, thanks to his energetic nature, and held himself in readiness to profit by the least chance that might offer itself to him. What he most desired to know was to what market the agents were taking the convoy of slaves. Was it to one of the factories of Angola, and would it be an affair of a few halting-places only, or would this convoy travel for hundreds of miles still, across Central Africa?",test,0,2,0,human could would interest either would try find put communication failed would endeavor concert perhaps carry deliver force night halts mingling prisoners black like could deceive soldiers vigilance reach break bonds lead away forest free would safety water course would enable descend coast would take plan unfortunately prevented natives attack new chances success greater knowledge difficulties young novice thus alternated fear hope fact resisted despair thanks energetic nature held readiness profit least chance might offer desired know market agents taking convoy slaves one factories would affair haltingplaces would convoy travel hundreds miles still across
5099,"The principal market of the contractors is that of N'yangwe, in Manyema, on that meridian which divides the African continent into two almost equal parts, there where extends the country of the great lakes, that Livingstone was then traversing. But it was far from the camp on the Coanza to that village. Months of travel would not suffice to reach it. That was one of Dick Sand's most serious thoughts; for, once at N'yangwe, in case even Mrs. Weldon, Hercules, the other blacks and he should succeed in escaping, how difficult it would be, not to say impossible, to return to the seacoast, in the midst of the dangers of such a long route. But Dick Sand soon had reason to think that the convoy would soon reach its destination. Though he did not understand the language employed by the chiefs of the caravan, sometimes Arab, sometimes the African idiom, he remarked that the name of an important market of that region was often pronounced. It was the name Kazounde, and he knew that a very great trade in slaves was carried on there. He was then naturally led to believe that there the fate of the prisoners would be decided, whether for the profit of the king of that district or for the benefit of some rich trader of the country. We know that he was not mistaken.

5100,"The distance from Saint Paul de Loanda to this city does not exceed four hundred miles, and consequently two hundred and fifty miles, at the most, separates it from the camp established on the Coanza. Dick Sand made his calculation approximately, taking the distance traveled by the little troop under Harris's lead as the base. Now, under ordinary circumstances, this journey would only require from ten to twelve days. Doubling that time for the needs of a caravan already exhausted by a long route, Dick Sand might estimate the length of the journey from the Coanza to Kazounde at three weeks. Dick Sand wished very much to impart what he believed he knew to Tom and his companions. It would be a kind of consolation for them to be assured that they were not being led to the center of Africa, into those fatal countries which they could not hope to leave. Now, a few words uttered in passing would be sufficient to enlighten them. Would he succeed in saying those words?

5101,"Dick Sand, free in his movements, resolved to gradually diminish the distance that separated him from his companions to fifty steps. He then commenced to maneuver to that end. Very likely old Tom divined Dick Sand's thought. A word, pronounced in a low voice, warned his companions to be attentive. They did not stir, but they kept themselves ready to see, as well as to hear. Soon, with an indifferent air, Dick Sand had gained fifty steps more. From the place where he then was, he could have called out, in such a manner as to be heard, that name Kazounde, and tell them what the probable length of the journey would be. But to complete his instructions, and confer with them on their conduct during the journey, would be still better. He then continued to draw nearer to them. Already his heart was beating with hope; he was only a few steps from the desired end, when the overseer, as if he had suddenly penetrated his intention, rushed on him.",test,0,1,0,free movements resolved gradually diminish distance separated companions fifty steps commenced maneuver end likely old divined thought word pronounced low voice warned companions attentive stir kept ready see well hear indifferent air gained fifty steps place could called manner heard name tell probable length journey would complete instructions confer conduct journey would still better continued draw nearer heart beating hope steps desired end overseer suddenly penetrated intention rushed
5102,"At the cries of that enraged person, ten soldiers ran to the spot, and Dick Sand was brutally led back to the rear, while Tom and his companions were taken to the other extremity of the camp. Exasperated, Dick Sand had thrown himself upon the overseer. He had ended by breaking his gun in his hands. He had almost succeeded in snatching it from him. But seven or eight soldiers assailed him at once, and force was used to secure him. Furious, they would have massacred him, if one of the chiefs of the caravan, an Arab of great height and ferocious physiognomy, had not intervened. This Arab was the chief Ibn Hamis, of whom Harris had spoken. He pronounced a few words which Dick Sand could not understand, and the soldiers, obliged to release their prey, went away. It was, then, very evident, for one thing, that there had been a formal order not to allow the young novice to communicate with his companions; and for another, that his life should not be taken.

5103,"At that moment--it was nine o'clock in the morning, April 19th--the harsh sounds from a ""condou's"" horn (a kind of ruminating animal among the African deer) burst forth, and the drum was heard. The halt was going to end. All, chiefs, porters, soldiers, slaves, were immediately on foot. Laden with their packs, several groups of captives were formed under the leadership of an overseer, who unfurled a banner of bright colors. The signal for departure was given. Songs then rose on the air; but they were the vanquished, not the vanquishers, who sang thus. This is what they said in these songs--a threatening expression of a simple faith from the slaves against their oppressors--against their executioners:  ""You have sent me to the coast, but I shall be dead; I shall have a yoke no longer, and I shall return to kill you"".

5104,"It was, besides, the period of the ""masika,"" the second period of the rainy season, under this zone of the African heaven. The nights in particular would be rainy during one, two, or three weeks, which could only increase the misery of the caravan. It set out that day in cloudy weather, and, after quitting the banks of the Coanza, made its way almost directly to the east. Fifty soldiers marched at the head, a hundred on each of the two sides of the convoy, the rest as a rear-guard. It would be difficult for the prisoners to flee, even if they had not been chained. Women, children, and men were going pell-mell, and the overseers urged them on with the whip. There were unfortunate mothers who, nursing one child, held a second by the hand that was free. Others dragged these little beings along, without clothing, without shoes, on the sharp grasses of the soil. The chief of the caravan, that ferocious Ibn Hamis, who had interfered in the struggle between Dick Sand and his overseer, watched this whole troop, going backwards and forwards from the head to the foot of the long column. If his agents and he troubled themselves but little about the sufferings of their captives, they must reckon more seriously either with the soldiers who claimed some additional rations, or with the ""pagazis"" who wanted to halt.",test,0,2,0,besides period second period rainy season zone heaven nights particular would rainy one two three weeks could increase misery caravan set day cloudy weather quitting banks made way almost directly east soldiers marched head hundred two sides convoy rest rearguard would difficult prisoners flee even chained children men going pellmell overseers urged whip unfortunate mothers nursing one child held second hand free dragged little beings along without clothing without shoes sharp grasses soil chief caravan ferocious interfered struggle overseer watched whole troop going backwards forwards head foot long column agents troubled little sufferings captives must reckon seriously either soldiers claimed additional rations wanted halt
5105,"Thence discussions; often even an exchange of brutality. The slaves suffered more from the overseers' constant irritation. Nothing was heard but threats from one side, and cries of grief from the other. Those who marched in the last ranks treaded a soil that the first had stained with their blood. Dick Sand's companions, always carefully kept in front of the convoy, could have no communication with him. They advanced in file, the neck held in the heavy fork, which did not permit a single head-movement. The whips did not spare them any more than their sad companions in misfortune. Bat, coupled with his father, marched before him, taxing his ingenuity not to shake the fork, choosing the best places to step on, because old Tom must pass after him. From time to time, when the overseer was a little behind, he uttered various words of encouragement, some of which reached Tom. He even tried to retard his march, if he felt that Tom was getting tired.",test,0,1,0,discussions often even exchange brutality slaves suffered overseers constant irritation heard threats one side cries grief marched last ranks treaded soil first stained blood companions always carefully kept front convoy could communication advanced file neck held heavy fork permit single headmovement whips spare sad companions misfortune coupled father marched taxing ingenuity shake fork choosing best places step old must pass time time overseer little behind uttered various words encouragement reached even tried retard march felt getting tired
5106,"It was suffering, for this good son to be unable to turn his head towards his good father, whom he loved. Doubtless, Tom had the satisfaction of seeing his son; however, he paid dear for it. How many times great tears flowed from his eyes when the overseer's whip fell upon Bat! It was a worse punishment than if it had fallen on his own flesh. Austin and Acteon marched a few steps behind, tied to each other, and brutally treated every moment. Ah, how they envied Hercules's fate! Whatever were the dangers that threatened the latter in that savage country, he could at least use his strength and defend his life. During the first moments of their captivity, old Tom had finally made known the whole truth to his companions. They had learned from him, to their profound astonishment, that they were in Africa; that Negoro's and Harris's double treachery had first thrown them there, and then led them away, and that no pity was to be expected from their masters.

5107,"She made part of a group of women who occupied the middle of the convoy. They had chained her with a young mother of two children, one at the breast, the other aged three years, who walked with difficulty. Nan, moved with pity, had burdened herself with the little creature, and the poor slave had thanked her by a tear. Nan then carried the infant, at the same time, sparing her the fatigue, to which she would have yielded, and the blows the overseer would have given her. But it was a heavy burden for old Nan. She felt that her strength would soon fail her, and then she thought of little Jack. She pictured him to herself in his mother's arms.

The head of the long caravan was only visible to him when it was crossing some plain. He walked, a prey, to the saddest thoughts, from which the agents' cries hardly drew his attention. He neither thought of himself, nor the fatigues he must still support, nor of the tortures probably reserved for him by Negoro. He only thought of Mrs. Weldon. In rain he sought on the ground, on the brambles by the paths, on the lower branches of the trees, to find some trace of her passage.

5109,"Such was the situation of the young novice and his companions in body and mind. But whatever they might have to fear for themselves, great as was their own sufferings, pity took possession of them on seeing the frightful misery of that sad troop of captives, and the revolting brutality of their masters. Alas! they could do nothing to succor the afflicted, nothing to resist the others. All the country situated east of the Coanza was only a forest for over an extent of twenty miles. The trees, however, whether they perish under the biting of the numerous insects of these countries, or whether troops of elephants beat them down while they are still young, are less crowded here than in the country next to the seacoast. The march, then, under the trees, would not present obstacles. The shrubs might be more troublesome than the trees. There was, in fact, an abundance of those cotton-trees, seven to eight feet high, the cotton of which serves to manufacture the black and white striped stuffs used in the interior of the province. In certain places, the soil transformed itself into thick jungles, in which the convoy disappeared.",test,0,2,0,situation young novice companions body mind whatever might fear great sufferings pity took possession seeing frightful misery sad troop captives revolting brutality masters could nothing succor afflicted nothing resist others country situated east forest extent twenty miles trees however whether perish biting numerous insects countries whether troops elephants beat still young less crowded country next seacoast march trees would present obstacles shrubs might troublesome trees fact abundance cottontrees seven eight feet high cotton serves manufacture black white striped stuffs used interior province certain places soil transformed thick jungles convoy disappeared
5110,"Of all the animals of the country, the elephants and giraffes alone were taller than those reeds which resemble bamboos, those herbs, the stalks of which measure an inch in diameter. The agents must know the country marvelously well, not to be lost in these jungles. Each day the caravan set out at daybreak, and only halted at midday for an hour. Some packs containing tapioca were then opened, and this food was parsimoniously distributed to the slaves. To this potatoes were added, or goat's meat and veal, when the soldiers had pillaged some village in passing. But the fatigue had been such, the repose so insufficient, so impossible even during these rainy nights, that when the hour for the distribution of food arrived the prisoners could hardly eat. So, eight days after the departure from the Coanza, twenty had fallen by the way, at the mercy of the beasts that prowled behind the convoy. Lions, panthers and leopards waited for the victims which could not fail them, and each evening after sunset their roaring sounded at such a short distance that one might fear a direct attack. On hearing those roars, rendered more formidable by the darkness, Dick Sand thought with terror of the obstacles such encounters would present against Hercules's enterprise, of the perils that menaced each of his steps. And meanwhile if he himself should find an opportunity to flee, he would not hesitate.",test,0,2,0,animals country elephants giraffes alone taller reeds resemble bamboos herbs stalks measure inch diameter agents must know country marvelously well lost jungles day caravan set daybreak halted midday hour packs containing tapioca opened food parsimoniously distributed slaves potatoes added goats meat veal soldiers pillaged village passing fatigue repose insufficient impossible even rainy nights hour distribution food arrived prisoners could hardly eat eight days departure twenty fallen way mercy beasts prowled behind convoy panthers leopards waited victims could fail evening sunset roaring sounded short distance one might fear direct attack hearing roars rendered formidable darkness thought terror obstacles encounters would present enterprise perils menaced steps meanwhile find opportunity flee would hesitate

5142,"The Portuguese authorities of St. Paul de Loanda, or of Benguela, could not stop it without difficulty, for the convoys traveled towards the interior of the African continent. The pens near the coast overflowed with prisoners, the few slavers that succeeded in eluding the cruisers along the shore not being sufficient to carry all of them to the Spanish colonies of America. Kazounde, situated three hundred miles from the mouth of the Coanza, is one of the principal ""lakonis,"" one of the most important markets of the province. On its grand square the ""tchitoka"" business is transacted; there, the slaves are exposed and sold. It is from this point that the caravans radiate toward the region of the great lakes. Kazounde, like all the large towns of Central Africa, is divided into two distinct parts. One is the quarter of the Arab, Portuguese or native traders, and it contains their pens; the other is the residence of the negro king, some ferocious crowned drunkard, who reigns through terror, and lives from supplies furnished by the contractors. At Kazounde, the commercial quarter then belonged to that Jose-Antonio Alvez, of whom Harris and Negoro had spoken, they being simply agents in his pay. This contractor's principal establishment was there, he had a second at Bihe, and a third at Cassange, in Benguela, which Lieutenant Cameron visited some years later.

5143,"At the end of the street was the vast ""tchitoka"" surrounded by slave-pens. Above this collection of buildings rose some enormous banyans, whose branches swayed with graceful movements. Here and there great palms, with their heads in the air, drove the dust on the streets like brooms. Twenty birds of prey watched over the public health. Such is the business quarter of Kazounde. Near by ran the Louhi, a river whose course, still undetermined, is an affluent, or at least a sub-affluent, of the Coango, a tributary of the Zoire. The residence of the King of Kazounde, which borders on the business quarter, is a confused collection of ill-built hovels, which spread over the space of a mile square. Of these hovels, some are open, others are inclosed by a palisade of reeds, or bordered with a hedge of fig-trees. In one particular enclosure, surrounded by a fence of papyrus, thirty of these huts served us dwellings for the chief's slaves, in another group lived his wives, and a ""tembe,"" still larger and higher, was half hidden in a plantation of cassada.

5144,"He had not four thousand of soldiers there, where the principal Portuguese traders could count twenty thousand, and he could no longer, as in former times, decree the sacrifice of twenty-five or thirty slaves a day. This king was, besides, a prematurely-aged man, exhausted by debauch, crazed by strong drink, a ferocious maniac, mutilating his subjects, his officers or his ministers, as the whim seized him, cutting the nose and ears off some, and the foot or the hand from others. His own death, not unlooked for, would be received without regret. A single man in all Kazounde might, perhaps, lose by the death of Moini Loungga. This was the contractor, Jose-Antonio Alvez, who agreed very well with the drunkard, whose authority was recognized by the whole province. If the accession of his first wife, Queen Moini, should be contested, the States of Moini Loungga might be invaded by a neighboring competitor, one of the kings of Oukonson. The latter, being younger and more active, had already seized some villages belonging to the Kazounde government. He had in his services another trader, a rival of Alvez Tipo-Tipo, a black Arab of a pure race, whom Cameron met at N'yangwe.

5145,"There was nothing Portuguese about him but his name, borrowed, no doubt, for the needs of commerce. He was a real negro, well known among traders, and called Kenndele. He was born, in fact, at Donndo, or the borders of the Coanza. He had commenced by being simply the agent of the slave-brokers, and would have finished as a famous trader, that is to say, in the skin of an old knave, who called himself the most honest man in the world. Cameron met this Alvez in the latter part of 1874, at Kilemmba, the capital of Kassonngo, chief of Ouroua. He guided Cameron with his caravan to his own establishment at Bihe, over a route of seven hundred miles. The convoy of slaves, on arriving at Kazounde, had been conducted to the large square.

The drums were beaten, horns were blown in the midst of the detonations of fire-arms. The soldiers guarding the caravan discharged their guns in the air, and the men employed by Jose-Antonio Alvez replied with interest. All these bandits were happy at meeting again, after an absence which had lasted for four months. They were now going to rest and make up for lost time in excesses and idleness. The prisoners then formed a total of two hundred and fifty, the majority being completely exhausted. After having been driven like cattle, they were to be shut up in pens, which American farmers would not have used for pigs. Twelve or fifteen hundred other captives awaited them, all of whom would be exposed in the market at Kazounde on the next day but one.

5147,"The heavy forks had been taken off them, but they were still in chains. The ""pagazis"" had stopped on the square after having disposed of their loads of ivory, which the Kazounde dealers would deliver. Then, being paid with a few yards of calico or other stuff at the highest price, they would return and join some other caravan. Old Tom and his companions had been freed from the iron collar which they had carried for five weeks. Bat and his father embraced each other, and all shook hands; but no one ventured to speak. What could they say that would not be an expression of despair. Bat, Acteon and Austin, all three vigorous, accustomed to hard work, had been able to resist fatigue; but old Tom, weakened by privations, was nearly exhausted. A few more days and his corpse would have been left, like poor Nan's, as food for the beasts of the province. As soon as they arrived, the four men had been placed in a narrow pen, and the door had been at once shut upon them.

5148,"Dick Sand had remained alone on the square, under the special care of a keeper. At length he was at Kazounde, where he did not doubt that Mrs. Weldon, little Jack, and Cousin Benedict had preceded him. He had looked for them in crossing the various quarters of the town, even in the depths of the ""tembes"" that lined the streets, on this ""tchitoka"" now almost deserted. Mrs. Weldon was not there. ""Have they not brought her here""? he asked himself. ""But where could she be? No; Hercules cannot be mistaken.

But Harris and Negoro, particularly the latter, should hasten to see him, now in their power, if only to enjoy their triumph--to insult him, torture him, perhaps avenge themselves. From the fact that they were not there, must he conclude that they had taken another direction, and that Mrs. Weldon was to be conducted to some other point of Central Africa? Should the presence of the American and the Portuguese be the signal for his punishment, Dick Sand impatiently desired it. Harris and Negoro at Kazounde, was for him the certainty that Mrs. Weldon and her child were also there. Dick Sand then told himself that, since the night when Dingo had brought him Hercules's note, the dog had not been seen. The young man had prepared an answer at great risks. In it he told Hercules to think only of Mrs. Weldon, not to lose sight of her, and to keep her informed as well as possible of what happened; but he had not been able to send it to its destination.

5150,"Perhaps Hercules was following Mrs. Weldon, as Dick Sand would have done in his place. Followed by Dingo, he might have plunged into the depths of the woody plateau of Africa, in the hope of reaching one of the interior establishments. What could Dick Sand imagine if, in fact, neither Mrs. Weldon nor her enemies were there? He had been so sure, perhaps foolishly, of finding them at Kazounde, that not to see them there at once gave him a terrible shock. He felt a sensation of despair that he could not subdue. His life, if it were no longer useful to those whom he loved, was good for nothing, and he had only to die. But, in thinking in that manner, Dick Sand mistook his own character. Under the pressure of these trials, the child became a man, and with him discouragement could only be an accidental tribute paid to human nature.

This name was repeated by a crowd of natives and soldiers who now invaded the grand square. The man on whom the fate of so many unfortunate people depended was about to appear. It was possible that his agents, Harris and Negoro, were with him. Dick Sand stood upright, his eyes open, his nostrils dilated.

Along with Alvez appeared his friend Coimbra, the son of Major Coimbra of Bihe, and, according to Lieutenant Cameron, the greatest scamp in the province. He was a dirty creature, his breast was uncovered, his eyes were bloodshot, his hair was rough and curly, his face yellow; he was dressed in a ragged shirt and a straw petticoat. He would have been called a horrible old man in his tattered straw hat. This Coimbra was the confidant, the tool of Alvez, an organizer of raids, worthy of commanding the trader's bandits.

To Dick Sand's great disappointment, neither Harris nor Negoro appeared in the crowd that followed Alvez. Must he, then, renounce all hope of finding them at Kazounde? Meanwhile, the chief of the caravan, the Arab, Ibn Hamis, shook hands with Alvez and Coimbra. He received numerous congratulations. Alvez made a grimace at the fifty per cent. of slaves failing in the general count, but, on the whole, the affair was very satisfactory. With what the trader possessed of human merchandise in his pens, he could satisfy the demands from the interior, and barter slaves for ivory teeth and those ""hannas"" of copper, a kind of St. Andrew's cross, in which form this metal is carried into the center of Africa.

5154,"”     Chapter VII. THE INTERIOR OF THE MUSKETEERS   When D’Artagnan was out of the Louvre, and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, Athos advised him to order a good repast at the Pomme-de-Pin, Porthos to engage a lackey, and Aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress. The repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited at table. The repast had been ordered by Athos, and the lackey furnished by Porthos. He was a Picard, whom the glorious Musketeer had picked up on the Bridge Tournelle, making rings and plashing in the water. Porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization, and he had brought him away without any other recommendation. The noble carriage of this gentleman, for whom he believed himself to be engaged, had won Planchet—that was the name of the Picard. He felt a slight disappointment, however, when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton, and when Porthos signified to him that the state of his household, though great, would not support two servants, and that he must enter into the service of D’Artagnan. Nevertheless, when he waited at the dinner given by his master, and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it, he believed his fortune made, and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a Crœsus. He preserved this opinion even after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence; but when in the evening he made his master’s bed, the chimeras of Planchet faded away.",test,1,3,0,consulted friends upon use best make share forty pistoles advised order good repast engage lackey provide suitable mistress repast carried effect day lackey waited table repast ordered lackey furnished glorious picked making rings plashing water pretended occupation proof reflective contemplative organization brought away without recommendation noble carriage gentleman believed engaged name felt slight disappointment however saw place already taken compeer named signified state household though great would support two servants must enter service waited dinner given master saw take handful gold pay believed fortune made returned thanks heaven thrown service preserved opinion even feast remnants repaired long abstinence evening made masters bed chimeras faded away
5155,"The bed was the only one in the apartment, which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom. Planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of D’Artagnan, and which D’Artagnan from that time made shift to do without. Athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named Grimaud. He was very taciturn, this worthy signor. Be it understood we are speaking of Athos. During the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions, Porthos and Aramis, they could remember having often seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. His words were brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more; no embellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques. His conversation was a matter of fact, without a single romance. Although Athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress. He never spoke of women.",test,1,2,0,bed one apartment consisted antechamber bedroom slept antechamber upon coverlet taken bed time made shift without part valet trained service thoroughly peculiar fashion named taciturn worthy signor understood speaking five six years lived strictest intimacy companions could remember often seen smile never heard laugh words brief expressive conveying meant embellishments embroidery arabesques conversation matter fact without single romance scarcely thirty years old great personal beauty intelligence mind one knew whether ever mistress never spoke women
5156,"He certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him, although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation, in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks, was very disagreeable to him. His reserve, his roughness, and his silence made almost an old man of him. He had, then, in order not to disturb his habits, accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips. He never spoke to him, except under the most extraordinary occasions. Sometimes, Grimaud, who feared his master as he did fire, while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents, believed he perfectly understood what he wanted, flew to execute the order received, and did precisely the contrary. Athos then shrugged his shoulders, and, without putting himself in a passion, thrashed Grimaud. On these days he spoke a little. Porthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of Athos. He not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we must render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not. He talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk.",test,1,2,0,certainly prevent others speaking although easy perceive kind conversation mingled bitter words misanthropic remarks disagreeable reserve roughness silence made almost old man order disturb habits accustomed obey upon simple gesture upon simple movement lips never spoke except extraordinary occasions feared master fire entertaining strong attachment person great veneration talents believed perfectly understood wanted flew execute order received precisely contrary shrugged shoulders without putting passion thrashed days spoke little seen character exactly opposite talked much talked loudly little caring must render justice whether anybody listened talked pleasure talking pleasure hearing talk
5157,"He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences, alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood. He had not so noble an air as Athos, and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress. But with his simple Musketeer’s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot, Athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second rank. Porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of M. de Tréville and the guardroom of the Louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes, after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from the lawyer’s dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less with Porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him. An old proverb says, “Like master, like man”. Let us pass, then, from the valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos, from Grimaud to Mousqueton. Mousqueton was a Norman, whose pacific name of Boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqueton. He had entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two hours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants. Porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing suited him wonderfully well. He had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast-off cloaks for Mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent tailor, who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make Porthos descend from his aristocratic habits, Mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master.",test,1,3,0,spoke upon subjects except sciences alleging respect inveterate hatred borne scholars childhood noble air commencement intimacy often rendered unjust toward gentleman endeavored eclipse splendid dress simple uniform nothing manner threw back head advanced foot instantly took place due consigned ostentatious second rank consoled filling antechamber de guardroom accounts love scrapes passed professional ladies military ladies lawyers dame baroness question nothing less foreign princess enormously fond old proverb says master like man us pass valet valet whose pacific name master changed infinitely sonorous name entered service upon condition clothed lodged though handsome manner claimed two hours day consecrated employment would provide wants agreed bargain thing suited wonderfully well doublets cut old clothes castoff cloaks thanks intelligent tailor made clothes look good new turning whose wife suspected wishing make descend aristocratic habits made good figure attending master
5158,"As for Aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character—a character which, like that of his companions, we shall be able to follow in its development—his lackey was called Bazin. Thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders, he was always clothed in black, as became the servant of a churchman. He was a Berrichon, thirty-five or forty years old, mild, peaceable, sleek, employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works, providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes, but excellent. For the rest, he was dumb, blind, and deaf, and of unimpeachable fidelity. And now that we are acquainted, superficially at least, with the masters and the valets, let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them. Athos dwelt in the Rue Férou, within two steps of the Luxembourg. His apartment consisted of two small chambers, very nicely fitted up, in a furnished house, the hostess of which, still young and still really handsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him. Some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging; a sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to the times of Francis I, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with precious stones, might be worth two hundred pistoles, and which, nevertheless, in his moments of greatest distress Athos had never pledged or offered for sale.

5159,"One day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even to borrow it of Athos. Athos, without saying anything, emptied his pockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold chains, and offered them all to Porthos; but as to the sword, he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings. In addition to the sword, there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry III. , dressed with the greatest elegance, and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost; and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos, certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble, a knight of the Order of the King, was his ancestor. Besides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as the sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece, and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture. Athos always carried the key of this coffer about him; but he one day opened it before Porthos, and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and papers—love letters and family papers, no doubt. Porthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous appearance, in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier. Every time he passed with a friend before his windows, at one of which Mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery, Porthos raised his head and his hand, and said, “That is my abode! ” But he was never to be found at home; he never invited anybody to go up with him, and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches. As to Aramis, he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir, an eating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were, on the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.",test,1,3,0,day appointment duchess endeavored even borrow without saying anything emptied pockets got together jewels purses aiguillettes gold chains offered sword said sealed place never quit master quit lodgings addition sword portrait representing nobleman time dressed greatest elegance wore portrait certain resemblances lines certain family likenesses indicated great noble knight ancestor casket magnificent goldwork arms sword portrait formed middle ornament mantelpiece assorted badly rest furniture always carried key coffer one day opened convinced coffer contained nothing letters papers—love letters family papers doubt lived apartment large size sumptuous appearance du time passed friend windows one sure placed full livery raised head hand said abode never found home never invited anybody go one could form idea sumptuous apartment contained shape real riches dwelt little lodging composed boudoir eating room bedroom room situated others ground floor looked upon little fresh green garden shady impenetrable eyes neighbors
5160,"With regard to D’Artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey, Master Planchet. D’Artagnan, who was by nature very curious—as people generally are who possess the genius of intrigue—did all he could to make out who Athos, Porthos, and Aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of these young men concealed his family name)—Athos in particular, who, a league away, savored of nobility. He addressed himself then to Porthos to gain information respecting Athos and Aramis, and to Aramis in order to learn something of Porthos. Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself. It was said Athos had met with great crosses in love, and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man. What could this treachery be? All the world was ignorant of it. As to Porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his two comrades), his life was very easily known. Vain and indiscreet, it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal. The only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself.",test,1,2,0,regard know lodged already made acquaintance lackey nature curious—as people generally possess genius intrigue—did could make really pseudonyms young men concealed family name—athos particular league away savored nobility addressed gain information respecting order learn something knew nothing life silent companion revealed said met great crosses love frightful treachery forever poisoned life gallant man could treachery world ignorant except real name case two comrades life easily known indiscreet easy see crystal thing mislead investigator would belief good things said
5161,"With respect to Aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret about him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little to questions put to him about others, and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the Musketeer with a princess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor. “And you, my dear companion,” said he, “you speak of the baronesses, countesses, and princesses of others? ”  “_Pardieu! _ I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself, because he had paraded all these fine things before me. But be assured, my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, that if I had obtained them from any other source, or if they had been confided to me, there exists no confessor more discreet than myself”. “Oh, I don’t doubt that,” replied D’Artagnan; “but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms—a certain embroidered handkerchief, for instance, to which I owe the honor of your acquaintance? ”  This time Aramis was not angry, but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone, “My dear friend, do not forget that I wish to belong to the Church, and that I avoid all mundane opportunities. The handkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends. I was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves.

Athos and Porthos dragged me into this to occupy me. I had, at the moment of being ordained, a little difficulty with—But that would not interest you, and I am taking up your valuable time”. “Not at all; it interests me very much,” cried D’Artagnan; “and at this moment I have absolutely nothing to do”. “Yes, but I have my breviary to repeat,” answered Aramis; “then some verses to compose, which Madame d’Aiguillon begged of me. Then I must go to the Rue St. Honoré in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de Chevreuse. So you see, my dear friend, that if you are not in a hurry, I am very much in a hurry”.

5163,"Notwithstanding all the pains he took, D’Artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new-made friends. He formed, therefore, the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future. In the meanwhile, he looked upon Athos as an Achilles, Porthos as an Ajax, and Aramis as a Joseph. As to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough. Athos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. Nevertheless, he never borrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their service; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his creditor by six o’clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening. Porthos had his fits. On the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious; if he lost, he disappeared completely for several days, after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person, but with money in his purse. As to Aramis, he never played. He was the worst Musketeer and the most unconvivial companion imaginable.",test,1,2,0,pains took unable learn concerning three newmade friends formed therefore resolution believing present said past hoping certain extended revelations future meanwhile looked upon rest life four young friends joyous enough played rule unfortunately never borrowed sou companions although purse ever service played upon honor always awakened creditor six clock next morning pay debt preceding evening fits days insolent ostentatious lost disappeared completely several days reappeared pale face thinner person money purse never played worst unconvivial companion imaginable
5164,"He had always something or other to do. Sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, Aramis looked at his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company, to go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment. At other times he would return home to write a treatise, and requested his friends not to disturb him. At this Athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which so became his noble countenance, and Porthos would drink, swearing that Aramis would never be anything but a village _curé_. Planchet, D’Artagnan’s valet, supported his good fortune nobly. He received thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. When the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des Fossoyeurs—that is to say, when the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII. were consumed or nearly so—he commenced complaints which Athos thought nauseous, Porthos indecent, and Aramis ridiculous. Athos counseled D’Artagnan to dismiss the fellow; Porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good thrashing first; and Aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him. “This is all very easy for you to say,” replied D’Artagnan, “for you, Athos, who live like a dumb man with Grimaud, who forbid him to speak, and consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, Porthos, who carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your valet, Mousqueton; and for you, Aramis, who, always abstracted by your theological studies, inspire your servant, Bazin, a mild, religious man, with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled means and without resources—for me, who am neither a Musketeer nor even a Guardsman, what am I to do to inspire either the affection, the terror, or the respect in Planchet?",test,1,0,4,always something midst dinner everyone attraction wine warmth conversation believed two three hours longer enjoy table looked watch arose bland smile took leave company go said consult casuist appointment times would return home write treatise requested friends disturb would smile charming melancholy smile became noble countenance would drink swearing would never anything village valet supported good fortune nobly received thirty sous per day month returned lodgings gay chaffinch affable toward master wind adversity began blow upon housekeeping des say forty pistoles consumed nearly so—he commenced complaints thought nauseous indecent ridiculous counseled dismiss fellow opinion give good thrashing first contended master never attend anything civilities paid easy say replied live like dumb man forbid speak consequently never exchange ill words carry matters magnificent style god valet always abstracted theological studies inspire servant mild religious man profound respect without settled means without resources—for neither even inspire either affection terror respect
5165,"”  “This is serious,” answered the three friends; “it is a family affair. It is with valets as with wives, they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain. Reflect upon it”. D’Artagnan did reflect, and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally; which he did with the conscientiousness that D’Artagnan carried into everything. After having well beaten him, he forbade him to leave his service without his permission. “For,” added he, “the future cannot fail to mend; I inevitably look for better times. Your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me, and I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require”. This manner of acting roused much respect for D’Artagnan’s policy among the Musketeers. Planchet was equally seized with admiration, and said no more about going away. The life of the four young men had become fraternal.",test,1,2,0,serious answered three friends family affair valets wives must placed upon footing wish remain upon reflect resolved thrash provisionally conscientiousness carried everything well beaten forbade leave service without permission added future fail mend inevitably look better times fortune therefore made remain good master allow miss chance granting dismissal require manner acting roused much respect policy among equally seized admiration said going away life four young men become fraternal
5166,"D’Artagnan, who had no settled habits of his own, as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him, fell easily into the habits of his friends. They rose about eight o’clock in the winter, about six in summer, and went to take the countersign and see how things went on at M. de Tréville’s. D’Artagnan, although he was not a Musketeer, performed the duty of one with remarkable punctuality. He went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty. He was well known at the Hôtel of the Musketeers, where everyone considered him a good comrade. M. de Tréville, who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection, never ceased recommending him to the king. On their side, the three Musketeers were much attached to their young comrade. The friendship which united these four men, and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day, whether for dueling, business, or pleasure, caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another, from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice, or from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg. In the meanwhile the promises of M. de Tréville went on prosperously. One fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit D’Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards.",test,1,3,0,settled habits came province midst world quite new fell easily habits friends rose eight clock winter six summer went take countersign see things went de although performed duty one remarkable punctuality went guard always kept company whoever friends duty well known everyone considered good comrade de appreciated first glance bore real affection never ceased recommending king side three much attached young comrade friendship united four men need felt seeing another three four times day whether dueling business pleasure caused continually running one another like shadows constantly met seeking one another du meanwhile promises de went prosperously fine morning king commanded de admit cadet company
5167,"D’Artagnan, with a sigh, donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de Tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years—a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for D’Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise D’Artagnan withdrew, and the next day he began service. Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard with D’Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted D’Artagnan. Chapter VIII. CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE   In the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII. , like all other things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. At first, Athos supported the association for a time with his own means. Porthos succeeded him; and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed, he was able to provide for the wants of all for a fortnight.",test,1,2,0,sigh donned uniform would exchanged expense ten years existence de promised favor novitiate two years—a novitiate might besides abridged opportunity present render king signal service distinguish brilliant action promise withdrew next day began service became turn mount guard duty company le thus received four instead one admitted meantime forty pistoles like things world beginning end end four companions began somewhat embarrassed first supported association time means succeeded thanks one disappearances accustomed able provide wants fortnight
5168,"At last it became Aramis’s turn, who performed it with a good grace and who succeeded—as he said, by selling some theological books—in procuring a few pistoles. Then, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to M. de Tréville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could not go far with three Musketeers who were already much in arrears and a Guardsman who as yet had no pay at all. At length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they got together, as a last effort, eight or ten pistoles, with which Porthos went to the gaming table. Unfortunately he was in a bad vein; he lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given his word. Then the inconvenience became distress. The hungry friends, followed by their lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and Guard rooms, picking up among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for according to the advice of Aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right and left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need. Athos was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their lackeys with him. Porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them; Aramis had eight of them. He was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but little noise, and yet was much sought after. As to D’Artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province, and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the Guards.",test,1,3,0,last became turn performed good grace succeeded—as said selling theological books—in procuring pistoles accustomed recourse de made advances pay advances could go far three already much arrears yet pay length found likely really want got together last effort eight ten pistoles went gaming table bad vein lost together twentyfive pistoles given word inconvenience became distress hungry friends followed lackeys seen haunting quays rooms picking among friends abroad dinners could meet according advice prudent sow repasts right left prosperity order reap time need invited four times time took friends lackeys six occasions contrived manner friends partake eight man must already perceived made little noise yet much sought yet knew nobody capital found one chocolate breakfast house priest province one dinner house cornet
5169,"He took his army to the priest’s, where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months, and to the cornet’s, who performed wonders; but as Planchet said, “People do not eat at once for all time, even when they eat a good deal”. D’Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions—as the breakfast at the priest’s could only be counted as half a repast—in return for the feasts which Athos, Porthos, and Aramis had procured him. He fancied himself a burden to the society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month; and he set his mind actively to work. He reflected that this coalition of four young, brave, enterprising, and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks, fencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less witty. In fact, four men such as they were—four men devoted to one another, from their purses to their lives; four men always supporting one another, never yielding, executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common; four arms threatening the four cardinal points, or turning toward a single point—must inevitably, either subterraneously, in open day, by mining, in the trench, by cunning, or by force, open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain, however well it might be defended, or however distant it may seem. The only thing that astonished D’Artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this. He was thinking by himself, and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied, with which he did not doubt, as with the lever for which Archimedes sought, they should succeed in moving the world, when someone tapped gently at his door. D’Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it. From this phrase, “D’Artagnan awakened Planchet,” the reader must not suppose it was night, or that day was hardly come. No, it had just struck four.",test,1,3,0,took army priests devoured much provision would lasted two months cornets performed wonders said eat time even eat good deal thus felt humiliated procured one meal half companions—as breakfast priests could counted half repast—in return feasts procured fancied burden society forgetting perfectly juvenile good faith fed society month set mind actively work reflected coalition four young brave enterprising active men ought object swaggering walks fencing lessons practical jokes less witty fact four men were—four men devoted one another purses lives four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly together resolutions formed common four arms threatening four cardinal points turning toward single point—must inevitably either subterraneously open day mining trench cunning force open way toward object wished attain however well might defended however distant may seem thing astonished friends never thought thinking even seriously racking brain find direction single force four times multiplied doubt lever sought succeed moving world someone tapped gently door awakened ordered open phrase awakened reader must suppose night day hardly come struck four
5170,"Planchet, two hours before, had asked his master for some dinner, and he had answered him with the proverb, “He who sleeps, dines”. And Planchet dined by sleeping. A man was introduced of simple mien, who had the appearance of a tradesman. Planchet, by way of dessert, would have liked to hear the conversation; but the citizen declared to D’Artagnan that, what he had to say being important and confidential, he desired to be left alone with him. D’Artagnan dismissed Planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated. There was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each other, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which D’Artagnan bowed, as a sign that he listened. “I have heard Monsieur d’Artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man,” said the citizen; “and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him”. “Speak, monsieur, speak,” said D’Artagnan, who instinctively scented something advantageous. The citizen made a fresh pause and continued, “I have a wife who is seamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty. I was induced to marry her about three years ago, although she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the queen’s cloak bearer, is her godfather, and befriends her”.",test,1,3,0,two hours asked master dinner answered proverb sleeps dines dined sleeping man introduced simple mien appearance tradesman way dessert would liked hear conversation citizen declared say important confidential desired left alone dismissed requested visitor seated moment silence two men looked make preliminary acquaintance bowed sign listened heard dartagnan spoken brave young man said citizen reputation justly enjoys decided confide secret monsieur speak said instinctively scented something advantageous citizen made fresh pause continued wife seamstress queen monsieur deficient either virtue beauty induced marry three years ago although little dowry queens cloak bearer godfather befriends

It is you who have come to me. It is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me.

Did I not tell you that she was the goddaughter of Monsieur Laporte, the confidential man of the queen?

But your wife, monsieur, what has she to do with all this? ”  “Her devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove her from her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her Majesty’s secrets, or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy”.",test,1,1,2,replied knew nothing wished appear know everything going longer hatred vengeance queen believes— queen believe believes someone written name queens name make come come draw snare devil wife monsieur devotion queen known wish either remove mistress intimidate order obtain secrets seduce make use spy

The citizen followed him. “‘Do not seek your wife,’” read D’Artagnan; “‘she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for her. If you make a single step to find her you are lost. ’  “That’s pretty positive,” continued D’Artagnan; “but after all, it is but a menace”. “Yes; but that menace terrifies me.

Where are you going? ” cried the two Musketeers in a breath. “The man of Meung! ” replied D’Artagnan, and disappeared. D’Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to whom this man had confided some important missive. The opinion of Athos was that D’Artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion—and according to D’Artagnan’s portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman—would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter.",test,1,1,0,staircase met coming see separated rushed like dart going cried two breath man replied disappeared related friends adventure stranger well apparition beautiful foreigner man confided important missive opinion lost letter skirmish gentleman opinion—and according portrait stranger must gentleman—would incapable baseness stealing letter
5186,"Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to a cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the presence of D’Artagnan and his yellow horse. Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was better not to fathom them. They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from D’Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, D’Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on their way. When they entered D’Artagnan’s chamber, it was empty; the landlord, dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp. Chapter IX. D’ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF   As Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour, D’Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared as if by enchantment. D’Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to have begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned; but this proved useless—for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession, no one answered, and some of the neighbors, who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise, had assured him that that house, all the openings of which were tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six months. While D’Artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors, Aramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home D’Artagnan found the reunion complete.",test,1,3,0,saw nothing love meeting given lady cavalier cavalier lady disturbed presence yellow horse said sorts affairs mysterious better fathom understood words escaped affair hand thought overtaking man losing sight would return rooms kept way entered chamber empty landlord dreading consequences encounter doubtless take place young man stranger consistent character given judged prudent decamp foreseen expiration half hour returned missed man disappeared enchantment run sword hand neighboring streets found nobody resembling man sought came back point perhaps ought begun knock door stranger leaned proved useless—for though knocked ten twelve times succession one answered neighbors put noses windows brought doors noise assured house openings tightly closed inhabited six months running streets knocking doors joined companions returning home found reunion complete
5187,"“Well! ” cried the three Musketeers all together, on seeing D’Artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger. “Well! ” cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, “this man must be the devil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade, like a specter”. “Do you believe in apparitions? ” asked Athos of Porthos. “I never believe in anything I have not seen, and as I never have seen apparitions, I don’t believe in them”. “The Bible,” said Aramis, “makes our belief in them a law; the ghost of Samuel appeared to Saul, and it is an article of faith that I should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, Porthos”. “At all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this man is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair, gentlemen—an affair by which there were a hundred pistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained”. “How is that?",test,1,2,0,cried three together seeing enter brow covered perspiration countenance upset anger cried throwing sword upon bed man must devil person disappeared like phantom like shade like specter believe apparitions asked never believe anything seen never seen apparitions believe said belief law ghost appeared article faith sorry see doubt thrown upon events man devil body shadow illusion reality man born damnation flight caused us miss glorious affair gentlemen—an affair hundred pistoles perhaps gained
5188,"” cried Porthos and Aramis in a breath. As to Athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself with interrogating D’Artagnan by a look. “Planchet,” said D’Artagnan to his domestic, who just then insinuated his head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation, “go down to my landlord, Monsieur Bonacieux, and ask him to send me half a dozen bottles of Beaugency wine; I prefer that”. “Ah, ah! You have credit with your landlord, then? ” asked Porthos. “Yes,” replied D’Artagnan, “from this very day; and mind, if the wine is bad, we will send him to find better”. “We must use, and not abuse,” said Aramis, sententiously. “I always said that D’Artagnan had the longest head of the four,” said Athos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which D’Artagnan replied with a bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence. “But come, what is this about?",test,1,2,0,cried breath faithful system reticence contented interrogating look said domestic insinuated head halfopen door order catch fragments conversation landlord ask send half dozen bottles wine prefer ah credit landlord asked replied day mind wine bad send find better must use abuse said sententiously always said longest head four said uttered opinion replied bow immediately resumed accustomed silence come

He then related to his friends, word for word, all that had passed between him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the Jolly Miller. “Your affair is not bad,” said Athos, after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good; “and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man. Then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads”. “But observe,” cried D’Artagnan, “that there is a woman in the affair—a woman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured perhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress”. “Beware, D’Artagnan, beware,” said Aramis. “You grow a little too warm, in my opinion, about the fate of Madame Bonacieux. Woman was created for our destruction, and it is from her we inherit all our miseries”.",test,1,3,0,asked said us dear friend unless honor lady hazarded confidence case would better keep satisfied replied honor one cause complain tell related friends word word passed host man abducted wife worthy landlord difference hostelry affair bad said tasted like connoisseur indicated nod head thought wine good one may draw fifty sixty pistoles good man remains ascertain whether fifty sixty pistoles worth risk four heads observe cried woman affair—a woman carried woman doubtless threatened tortured perhaps faithful mistress beware said grow little warm opinion fate created destruction inherit miseries
5190,"At this speech of Aramis, the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit his lips. “It is not Madame Bonacieux about whom I am anxious,” cried D’Artagnan, “but the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes, and who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other”. “Why does she love what we hate most in the world, the Spaniards and the English? ”  “Spain is her country,” replied D’Artagnan; “and it is very natural that she should love the Spanish, who are the children of the same soil as herself. As to the second reproach, I have heard it said that she does not love the English, but an Englishman”. “Well, and by my faith,” said Athos, “it must be acknowledged that this Englishman is worthy of being loved. I never saw a man with a nobler air than his”. “Without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can,” said Porthos. “I was at the Louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and, _pardieu_, I picked up two that I sold for ten pistoles each.

I was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king”. “Which would not prevent me,” said D’Artagnan, “if I knew where the Duke of Buckingham was, from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn, I vow that I would voluntarily risk my head in doing it”. “And did the mercer*,” rejoined Athos, “tell you, D’Artagnan, that the queen thought that Buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter? ”  * Haberdasher   “She is afraid so”. “Wait a minute, then,” said Aramis. “What for? ” demanded Porthos. “Go on, while I endeavor to recall circumstances”. “And now I am convinced,” said D’Artagnan, “that this abduction of the queen’s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking, and perhaps with the presence of Buckingham in Paris”.",test,1,2,0,well gentlemen among seized garden queens equerry introduced school time adventure appeared cruel king would prevent said knew taking hand conducting queen enrage cardinal could find means play sharp turn vow would voluntarily risk head mercer rejoined queen thought brought forged letter afraid minute said demanded endeavor recall circumstances convinced said abduction queens woman connected events speaking perhaps presence

Athos smiled. “He resides in a quiet quarter,” continued Aramis; “his tastes and his profession require it. Now, at the moment when I left his house—”  Here Aramis paused. “Well,” cried his auditors; “at the moment you left his house? ”  Aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the full relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him, their ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.",test,1,2,0,full ideas said admiration like hear talk said dialect amuses cried said three friends house doctor theology sometimes consult studies smiled resides quiet quarter continued tastes profession require moment left house— paused cried auditors moment left house appeared make strong inward effort like man full relation falsehood finds stopped unforeseen obstacle eyes three companions fixed upon ears wide open means retreat
5193,"“This doctor has a niece,” continued Aramis. “Ah, he has a niece! ” interrupted Porthos. “A very respectable lady,” said Aramis. The three friends burst into laughter. “Ah, if you laugh, if you doubt me,” replied Aramis, “you shall know nothing”. “We believe like Mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones,” said Athos. “I will continue, then,” resumed Aramis. “This niece comes sometimes to see her uncle; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that I was, and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage”. “Ah!",test,1,4,1,doctor niece continued niece interrupted respectable lady said three friends burst laughter laugh doubt replied shall know nothing believe like mute tombstones said continue resumed niece comes sometimes see uncle chance yesterday time duty offer conduct carriage

Let us try not to jest, if we can. Go on Aramis, go on”. “All at once, a tall, dark gentleman—just like yours, D’Artagnan”. “The same, perhaps,” said he. “Possibly,” continued Aramis, “came toward me, accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him; and in the politest tone, ‘Monsieur Duke,’ said he to me, ‘and you madame,’ continued he, addressing the lady on my arm—”  “The doctor’s niece?",test,1,2,0,carriage niece doctor interrupted one whose faults great looseness tongue nice acquaintance friend replied occasion observe indiscreet injurious among women gentlemen cried began get glimpse result adventure thing serious us try jest go tall dark gentleman—just like perhaps said continued toward accompanied five six men followed ten paces behind politest tone said madame continued addressing lady arm— doctors niece

The devil! ” said Porthos. “Is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized? ”  “I can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person; but the face—”  “I had a large hat,” said Aramis. “Oh, good lord,” cried Porthos, “what precautions for the study of theology! ”  “Gentlemen, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “do not let us lose our time in jesting.",test,1,1,0,devil cried escapes fact said height something shape duke nevertheless appears dress wore enormous cloak said month devil said doctor afraid may recognized comprehend spy may deceived person face— large hat said good lord cried precautions study theology gentlemen said let us lose time jesting

Can you believe so? ” said Porthos, protruding his lips with contempt. “She is goddaughter to Laporte, the confidential valet of the queen. Have I not told you so, gentlemen? Besides, it has perhaps been her Majesty’s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly. High heads expose themselves from afar, and the cardinal is longsighted”. “Well,” said Porthos, “in the first place make a bargain with the mercer, and a good bargain”. “That’s useless,” said D’Artagnan; “for I believe if he does not pay us, we shall be well enough paid by another party”.",test,1,1,1,us separate let us seek mercers wife—that key intrigue woman inferior condition believe said protruding lips contempt goddaughter confidential valet queen told gentlemen perhaps calculation seek occasion support lowly heads expose afar cardinal longsighted said first place make bargain mercer good bargain useless said believe pay us shall well enough paid another party

Save me! Save me! ”  Porthos and Aramis arose. “A moment,” cried D’Artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their half-drawn swords. “It is not courage that is needed; it is prudence”. “And yet,” cried Porthos, “we will not leave—”  “You will leave D’Artagnan to act as he thinks proper,” said Athos.",test,1,1,0,moment sudden noise footsteps heard upon stairs door thrown violently open unfortunate mercer rushed chamber council held gentlemen love heaven save cried four men come arrest arose moment cried making sign replace scabbard halfdrawn swords courage needed prudence yet cried leave— leave act thinks proper said

At this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber, but seeing four Musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides, they hesitated about going farther. “Come in, gentlemen, come in,” called D’Artagnan; “you are here in my apartment, and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal”. “Then, gentlemen, you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received? ” asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party. “On the contrary, gentlemen, we would assist you if it were necessary”. “What does he say? ” grumbled Porthos. “You are a simpleton,” said Athos.",test,1,1,0,repeat longest head four part declare obey think best moment four appeared door antechamber seeing four standing swords sides hesitated going farther gentlemen come called apartment faithful servants king cardinal gentlemen oppose executing orders received asked one appeared leader party contrary gentlemen would assist necessary say grumbled simpleton said

I saw him today for the first time, and he can tell you on what occasion; he came to demand the rent of my lodging. Is that not true, Monsieur Bonacieux? Answer! ”  “That is the very truth,” cried the mercer; “but Monsieur does not tell you—”  “Silence, with respect to me, silence, with respect to my friends; silence about the queen, above all, or you will ruin everybody without saving yourself!

Gentlemen, once more, take him to prison, and keep him under key as long as possible; that will give me time to pay him”. The officers were full of thanks, and took away their prey. As they were going down D’Artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader. “May I not drink to your health, and you to mine? ” said D’Artagnan, filling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of M. Bonacieux. “That will do me great honor,” said the leader of the posse, “and I accept thankfully”. “Then to yours, monsieur—what is your name?",test,1,1,0,pushed halfstupefied mercer among saying shabby old fellow dear come demand money me—of prison take prison keep key long possible give time pay officers full thanks took away prey going laid hand shoulder leader drink health mine said filling two glasses wine obtained liberality great honor said leader posse accept thankfully monsieur—what name

The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of D’Artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was convinced. “What diabolical villainy you have performed here,” said Porthos, when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone. “Shame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst!",test,1,1,0,gentlemen name turn please monsieur others cried carried away enthusiasm king cardinal leader posse would perhaps doubted sincerity wine bad wine good convinced diabolical villainy performed said officer rejoined companions four friends found alone shame four allow unfortunate fellow cried help arrested midst

D’Artagnan, you are a great man; and when you occupy Monsieur de Tréville’s place, I will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey”. “Well, I am in a maze,” said Porthos; “do _you_ approve of what D’Artagnan has done? ”  “_Parbleu! _ Indeed I do,” said Athos; “I not only approve of what he has done, but I congratulate him upon it”. “And now, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, without stopping to explain his conduct to Porthos, “All for one, one for all—that is our motto, is it not? ”  “And yet—” said Porthos. “Hold out your hand and swear! ” cried Athos and Aramis at once.",test,1,2,1,gentleman hobnob bailiff said already told simpleton quite opinion great man occupy de place come ask influence secure abbey maze said approve done said approve done congratulate upon gentlemen said without stopping explain conduct one one all—that motto yet— said hand swear cried

Now let us everyone retire to his own home,” said D’Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; “and attention! For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal”. Chapter X. A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY   The invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police invented mousetraps. As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de Jerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap. When in a house, of whatever kind it may be, an individual suspected of any crime is arrested, the arrest is held secret. Four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room. The door is opened to all who knock. It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the _habitués_ of the establishment.",test,1,2,0,example grumbling nevertheless stretched hand four friends repeated one voice formula dictated one one well let us everyone retire home said done nothing command life attention moment feud cardinal invention mousetrap date days soon societies forming invented kind police police invented mousetraps perhaps readers familiar slang de fifteen years since applied word first time thing allow us explain mousetrap house whatever kind may individual suspected crime arrested arrest held secret five men placed ambuscade first room door opened knock closed arrested end two three days power almost establishment
5205,"And that is a mousetrap. The apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal’s people. It must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in which D’Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from this detention. Besides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered nothing. Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Tréville—a thing which, considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer, had very much astonished his captain. But M. de Tréville knew nothing, except that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the king, and the queen, the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king uneasy, and the redness of the queen’s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful. But this last circumstance was not striking, as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much. M. de Tréville requested Athos, whatever might happen, to be observant of his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to convey his desires to his comrades. As to D’Artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment. He converted his chamber into an observatory.",test,1,2,0,mousetrap apartment became mousetrap whoever appeared taken interrogated cardinals people must observed separate passage led first floor lodged called exempted detention nobody came thither three engaged earnest search inquiries discovered nothing even gone far question de thing considering habitual reticence worthy much astonished captain de knew nothing except last time seen cardinal king queen cardinal looked thoughtful king uneasy redness queens eyes donated sleepless tearful last circumstance striking queen since marriage slept badly wept much de requested whatever might happen observant duty king particularly queen begging convey desires comrades budge apartment converted chamber observatory

Then, having removed a plank from his floor, and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath, in which the interrogatories were made, he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused. The interrogatories, preceded by a minute search operated upon the persons arrested, were almost always framed thus: “Has Madame Bonacieux sent anything to you for her husband, or any other person? Has Monsieur Bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife, or for any other person? Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth? ”  “If they knew anything, they would not question people in this manner,” said D’Artagnan to himself. “Now, what is it they want to know? Why, they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has had, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen”. D’Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not wanting in probability. In the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise D’Artagnan’s vigilance.",test,1,2,0,windows saw visitors caught removed plank floor nothing remaining simple ceiling room beneath interrogatories made heard passed inquisitors accused interrogatories preceded minute search operated upon persons arrested almost always framed thus sent anything husband person sent anything wife person either confided anything word mouth knew anything would question people manner said want know want know likely interview queen held onto idea heard wanting probability meantime mousetrap continued operation likewise vigilance
5207,"On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux, as Athos had just left D’Artagnan to report at M. de Tréville’s, as nine o’clock had just struck, and as Planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was beginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. The door was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap. D’Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full length, and listened. Cries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle. There were no questions. “The devil! ” said D’Artagnan to himself. “It seems like a woman! They search her; she resists; they use force—the scoundrels! ”  In spite of his prudence, D’Artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below.",test,1,2,0,evening day arrest poor left report de nine clock struck yet made bed beginning task knocking heard street door door instantly opened shut someone taken mousetrap flew hole laid floor full length listened soon heard moans someone appeared endeavoring stifle questions devil said seems like woman search resists use force—the scoundrels spite prudence restrained great difficulty taking part scene going

The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four men. “Pardon, gentlemen—par—” murmured the voice, which could now only be heard in inarticulate sounds. “They are binding her; they are going to drag her away,” cried D’Artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor.",test,1,1,1,tell mistress house gentlemen tell tell belong queen cried unfortunate woman murmured lucky find everybody seeking voice became indistinct tumultuous movement shook partition victim resisted much woman could resist four men gentlemen—par— murmured voice could heard inarticulate sounds binding going drag away cried springing floor

Ah, I remember, Athos is at Monsieur de Tréville’s”. “But where are you going, monsieur, where are you going? ”  “I am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner,” cried D’Artagnan.",test,1,4,1,sword side seek three certainly home perhaps three take arms come run remember de going monsieur going going window order sooner cried
5210,"“You put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the door, and run as I told you”. “Oh, monsieur! Monsieur! You will kill yourself,” cried Planchet. “Hold your tongue, stupid fellow,” said D’Artagnan; and laying hold of the casement, he let himself gently down from the first story, which fortunately was not very elevated, without doing himself the slightest injury. He then went straight to the door and knocked, murmuring, “I will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap, but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse! ”  The knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased, steps approached, the door was opened, and D’Artagnan, sword in hand, rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux, the door of which, doubtless acted upon by a spring, closed after him. Then those who dwelt in Bonacieux’s unfortunate house, together with the nearest neighbors, heard loud cries, stamping of feet, clashing of swords, and breaking of furniture. A moment after, those who, surprised by this tumult, had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it, saw the door open, and four men, clothed in black, not _come_ out of it, but _fly_, like so many frightened crows, leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture, feathers from their wings; that is to say, patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks. D’Artagnan was conqueror—without much effort, it must be confessed, for only one of the officers was armed, and even he defended himself for form’s sake.",test,1,3,0,put back boards sweep floor go door run told monsieur kill cried tongue stupid fellow said laying hold casement let gently first story fortunately elevated without slightest injury went straight door knocked murmuring go caught mousetrap woe cats shall pounce upon mouse knocker scarcely sounded hand young man tumult ceased steps approached door opened sword hand rushed rooms door doubtless acted upon spring closed dwelt unfortunate house together nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping feet clashing swords breaking furniture moment surprised tumult gone windows learn cause saw door open four men clothed black like many frightened crows leaving ground corners furniture feathers wings say patches clothes fragments cloaks conqueror—without much effort must confessed one officers armed even defended forms sake
5211,"It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs, stools, and crockery; but two or three scratches made by the Gascon’s blade terrified them. Ten minutes sufficed for their defeat, and D’Artagnan remained master of the field of battle. The neighbors who had opened their windows, with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances, closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black flee—their instinct telling them that for the time all was over. Besides, it began to grow late, and then, as today, people went to bed early in the quarter of the Luxembourg. On being left alone with Mme. Bonacieux, D’Artagnan turned toward her; the poor woman reclined where she had been left, half-fainting upon an armchair. D’Artagnan examined her with a rapid glance. She was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six years, with dark hair, blue eyes, and a nose slightly turned up, admirable teeth, and a complexion marbled with rose and opal. There, however, ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of rank. The hands were white, but without delicacy; the feet did not bespeak the woman of quality.",test,1,2,0,true three others endeavored knock young man chairs stools crockery two three scratches made blade terrified minutes sufficed defeat remained master field battle neighbors opened windows coolness peculiar inhabitants times perpetual riots disturbances closed soon saw four men black flee—their instinct telling time began grow late today people went bed early quarter left alone turned toward poor woman reclined left halffainting upon armchair examined rapid glance charming woman twentyfive twentysix years dark hair blue eyes nose slightly turned admirable teeth complexion marbled rose opal however ended signs might confounded lady rank hands white without delicacy feet bespeak woman quality
5212,"Happily, D’Artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties. While D’Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have said, close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief, which he picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and Aramis to cut each other’s throat. From that time, D’Artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket of Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up. At that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her eyes, looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to him with a smile.

5213,"Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world. “Ah, monsieur! ” said she, “you have saved me; permit me to thank you”. “Madame,” said D’Artagnan, “I have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place; you owe me no thanks”. “Oh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took for robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here? ”  “Madame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband, Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the Bastille”. “My husband in the Bastille! ” cried Mme.

5214,"“Oh, my God! What has he done? Poor dear man, he is innocence itself! ”  And something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features of the young woman. “What has he done, madame? ” said D’Artagnan. “I believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband”. “But, monsieur, you know then—”  “I know that you have been abducted, madame”. “And by whom?

I do not know that”. “And did my husband know I had been carried off? ”  “He was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor himself”. “And does he suspect,” said Mme.

Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant? ”  “So far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above all, of your love”. A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman. “But,” continued D’Artagnan, “how did you escape? ”  “I took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the window. Then, as I believed my husband would be at home, I hastened hither”. “To place yourself under his protection? ”  “Oh, no, poor dear man!

The men I have put to flight will return reinforced; if they find us here, we are lost. I have sent for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home? ”  “Yes, yes! You are right,” cried the affrighted Mme. Bonacieux; “let us fly! Let us save ourselves”.

5218,"“But whither shall we fly—whither escape? ”  “Let us first withdraw from this house; afterward we shall see”. The young woman and the young man, without taking the trouble to shut the door after them, descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly, turned into the Rue des Fossés-Monsieur-le-Prince, and did not stop till they came to the Place St. Sulpice. “And now what are we to do, and where do you wish me to conduct you? ” asked D’Artagnan. “I am at quite a loss how to answer you, I admit,” said Mme. Bonacieux. “My intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte, through my husband, in order that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the Louvre in the last three days, and whether there is any danger in presenting myself there”. “But I,” said D’Artagnan, “can go and inform Monsieur Laporte”. “No doubt you could, only there is one misfortune, and that is that Monsieur Bonacieux is known at the Louvre, and would be allowed to pass; whereas you are not known there, and the gate would be closed against you”.",test,1,2,1,whither shall fly—whither escape us first withdraw house afterward shall see young woman young man without taking trouble shut door descended des rapidly turned des stop till came wish conduct asked quite loss answer admit said intention inform husband order might tell us precisely taken place last three days whether danger presenting said go inform doubt could one misfortune known would allowed pass whereas known gate would closed

Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man. “And if I give you this password,” said she, “would you forget it as soon as you used it? ”  “By my honor, by the faith of a gentleman! ” said D’Artagnan, with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it. “Then I believe you. You appear to be a brave young man; besides, your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness”. “I will do, without a promise and voluntarily, all that I can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen.

Yes, here it is”. “Who is this Athos? ”  “One of my friends”. “But if he should be at home and see me? ”  “He is not at home, and I will carry away the key, after having placed you in his apartment”. “But if he should return?",test,1,4,1,shall go meanwhile nobody whose house come fetch trust nobody said near door friends home see home carry away key placed apartment return

5222,"As D’Artagnan had foreseen, Athos was not within. He took the key, which was customarily given him as one of the family, ascended the stairs, and introduced Mme. Bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description. “You are at home,” said he. “Remain here, fasten the door inside, and open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this;” and he tapped thrice—two taps close together and pretty hard, the other after an interval, and lighter. “That is well,” said Mme. Bonacieux. “Now, in my turn, let me give you my instructions”. “I am all attention”. “Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre, on the side of the Rue de l’Echelle, and ask for Germain”.",test,1,1,0,foreseen within took key customarily given one family ascended stairs introduced little apartment given description home said fasten door inside open nobody unless hear three taps like tapped thrice—two taps close together pretty hard interval lighter well said turn let give instructions attention wicket side de lechelle ask

Bonacieux, darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person; and while he descended the stairs, he heard the door closed and double-locked. In two bounds he was at the Louvre; as he entered the wicket of L’Echelle, ten o’clock struck. All the events we have described had taken place within a half hour. Everything fell out as Mme.

5225,"In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in two words D’Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte assured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address, and set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he returned. “Young man,” said he to D’Artagnan, “a suggestion”. “What? ”  “You may get into trouble by what has taken place”. “You believe so? ”  “Yes.

5226,"”  “Well? ”  “Go and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is called an alibi”. D’Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Tréville’s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Tréville’s office. As D’Artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Tréville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Tréville was asking D’Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. “Pardon me, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Tréville’s clock three-quarters of an hour, “but I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you”. “Twenty-five minutes past nine! ” cried M. de Tréville, looking at the clock; “why, that’s impossible!",test,1,2,0,call upon order may give evidence half past nine court justice called alibi found advice prudent took heels soon de instead going saloon rest crowd asked introduced de office constantly frequented hôtel difficulty made complying request servant went inform de young compatriot something important communicate solicited private audience minutes de asking could serve caused visit late hour monsieur said profited moment left alone put back de clock threequarters hour thought yet twentyfive minutes past nine late wait upon minutes past nine cried de looking clock impossible

But what can I do for you? ”  Then D’Artagnan told M. de Tréville a long history about the queen. He expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty; he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of which M. de Tréville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we have said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and the queen. As ten o’clock was striking, D’Artagnan left M. de Tréville, who thanked him for his information, recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at the foot of the stairs, D’Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane. He consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a turn of his finger set the clock right again, that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street.

5228,"He was thinking of Mme. Bonacieux. For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love. Pretty, mysterious, initiated in almost all the secrets of the court, which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features, it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love. Moreover, D’Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her; and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character. D’Artagnan already fancied himself, so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination, accosted by a messenger from the young woman, who brought him some billet appointing a meeting, a gold chain, or a diamond. We have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame. Let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances, as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts. Without a blush, men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing. Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty, whence, without doubt, comes the proverb, “The most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has”.",test,1,2,0,thinking apprentice young woman almost ideal love mysterious initiated almost secrets court reflected charming gravity pleasing features might surmised wholly unmoved irresistible charm novices love delivered hands demons wished search ill treat important service established one sentiments gratitude easily assume tender character already fancied rapid flight dreams upon wings imagination accosted messenger young woman brought billet appointing meeting gold chain diamond observed young cavaliers received presents king without shame us add times lax morality delicacy respect mistresses latter almost always left valuable durable remembrances essayed conquer fragility sentiments solidity gifts blush men made way world means women blushing beautiful gave beauty whence without doubt comes proverb beautiful girl world give
5229,"Such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place, nor their battles afterward, without the purse, more or less furnished, which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow. D’Artagnan owned nothing. Provincial diffidence, that slight varnish, the ephemeral flower, that down of the peach, had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers gave their friend. D’Artagnan, following the strange custom of the times, considered himself at Paris as on a campaign, neither more nor less than if he had been in Flanders—Spain yonder, woman here. In each there was an enemy to contend with, and contributions to be levied. But, we must say, at the present moment D’Artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested. The mercer had said that he was rich; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as M. Bonacieux; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love, which had been the consequence of it. We say _almost_, for the idea that a young, handsome, kind, and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love, but on the contrary strengthens it. There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty. A fine and white stocking, a silken robe, a lace kerchief, a pretty slipper on the foot, a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty, but they make a pretty woman beautiful, without reckoning the hands, which gain by all this; the hands, among women particularly, to be beautiful must be idle.",test,1,3,0,rich gave addition part money vast number heroes gallant period may cited would neither spurs first place battles afterward without purse less furnished mistress fastened saddle bow owned nothing diffidence slight varnish ephemeral flower peach evaporated winds little orthodox counsels three gave friend following strange custom times considered campaign neither less yonder woman enemy contend contributions levied must say present moment ruled feeling much noble disinterested mercer said rich young man might easily guess weak man interest almost foreign commencement love consequence say idea young handsome kind witty woman time rich takes nothing beginning love contrary strengthens affluence crowd aristocratic cares caprices highly becoming beauty fine white stocking silken robe lace kerchief pretty slipper foot tasty ribbon head make ugly woman pretty make pretty woman beautiful without reckoning hands gain hands among women particularly beautiful must idle
5230,"Then D’Artagnan, as the reader, from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune, very well knows—D’Artagnan was not a millionaire; he hoped to become one someday, but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant. In the meanwhile, how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman’s happiness, and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings. At least, when the woman is rich and the lover is not, that which he cannot offer she offers to herself; and although it is generally with her husband’s money that she procures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him. Then D’Artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was at the same time a very devoted friend. In the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer’s wife, he did not forget his friends. The pretty Mme. Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St. Denis or in the fair of St. Germain, in company with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, to whom D’Artagnan had often remarked this. Then one could enjoy charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand of a friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. Besides, on pressing occasions, in extreme difficulties, D’Artagnan would become the preserver of his friends. And M.

5231,"We are compelled to admit to our readers that D’Artagnan thought nothing about him in any way; or that if he did think of him, it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was, wherever it might be. Love is the most selfish of all the passions. Let our readers reassure themselves. If D’Artagnan forgets his host, or appears to forget him, under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried, we will not forget him, and we know where he is. But for the moment, let us do as did the amorous Gascon; we will see after the worthy mercer later. D’Artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to the beautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the Rue Cherish-Midi, or Chase-Midi, as it was then called. As he found himself in the quarter in which Aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap. Now, if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his abode, he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps, they would not be able to conceive what all this meant. This mystery required an explanation; at least, so D’Artagnan declared to himself.

5232,"Bonacieux, of whom his head, if not his heart, was already full. We must never look for discretion in first love. First love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow, it will stifle you. Paris for two hours past had been dark, and seemed a desert. Eleven o’clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain. It was delightful weather. D’Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the Rue d’Assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard, and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night. From a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good shutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain. Arrived at the end of the lane, D’Artagnan turned to the left. The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni.",test,1,2,0,head heart already full must never look discretion first love love accompanied excessive joy unless joy allowed overflow stifle two hours past dark seemed desert clock sounded clocks delightful weather passing along lane spot dassas situated breathing balmy emanations borne upon wind de arose gardens refreshed dews evening breeze night distance resounded deadened however good shutters songs tipplers enjoying cabarets scattered along plain end lane turned left house dwelt situated
5233,"D’Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette, and already perceived the door of his friend’s house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni. This something was enveloped in a cloak, and D’Artagnan at first believed it was a man; but by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and the indecision of the step, he soon discovered that it was a woman. Further, this woman, as if not certain of the house she was seeking, lifted up her eyes to look around her, stopped, went backward, and then returned again. D’Artagnan was perplexed. “Shall I go and offer her my services? ” thought he. “By her step she must be young; perhaps she is pretty. Oh, yes! But a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover. If I should disturb a rendezvous, that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance”.",test,1,2,2,passed already perceived door friends house shaded mass sycamores clematis formed vast arch opposite front perceived something like shadow issuing something enveloped cloak first believed man smallness form hesitation walk indecision step soon discovered woman woman certain house seeking lifted eyes look around stopped went backward returned perplexed go offer services thought step must young perhaps pretty yes woman wanders streets hour ventures meet lover disturb rendezvous would best means commencing acquaintance
5234,"Meantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses and windows. This was neither long nor difficult. There were but three hôtels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward the road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis occupied, the other belonging to Aramis himself. “_Pardieu! _” said D’Artagnan to himself, to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted, “_pardieu_, it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend’s house. But on my soul, it looks so. Ah, my dear Aramis, this time I shall find you out”. And D’Artagnan, making himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche. The young woman continued to advance; and in addition to the lightness of her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice.

5235,"Nevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey, she resolutely drew near to Aramis’s shutter, and tapped, at three equal intervals, with her bent finger. “This is all very fine, dear Aramis,” murmured D’Artagnan. “Ah, Monsieur Hypocrite, I understand how you study theology”. The three blows were scarcely struck, when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter. “Ah, ah! ” said the listener, “not through doors, but through windows! Ah, this visit was expected. We shall see the windows open, and the lady enter by escalade. Very pretty! ”  But to the great astonishment of D’Artagnan, the shutter remained closed.",test,1,1,0,whether cough answered similar signal fixed irresolution nocturnal seeker whether without aid saw arrived end journey resolutely drew near shutter tapped three equal intervals bent finger fine dear murmured understand study theology three blows scarcely struck inside blind opened light appeared panes outside shutter ah said listener doors windows visit expected shall see windows open lady enter escalade pretty great astonishment shutter remained closed
5236,"Still more, the light which had shone for an instant disappeared, and all was again in obscurity. D’Artagnan thought this could not last long, and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears. He was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside. The young woman in the street replied by a single tap, and the shutter was opened a little way. It may be judged whether D’Artagnan looked or listened with avidity. Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber; but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night. Besides, the eyes of the Gascons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty of seeing in the dark. D’Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a handkerchief. She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object. This immediately recalled to D’Artagnan’s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of Mme.",test,1,2,0,light shone instant disappeared obscurity thought could last long continued look eyes listen ears right end seconds two sharp taps heard inside young woman street replied single tap shutter opened little way may judged whether looked listened avidity light removed another chamber eyes young man accustomed night eyes asserted like cats faculty seeing dark saw young woman took pocket white object unfolded quickly took form handkerchief made interlocutor observe corner unfolded object immediately recalled mind handkerchief found feet
5237,"Bonacieux, which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis. “What the devil could that handkerchief signify? ”  Placed where he was, D’Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis. We say Aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior. Curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding place, and quick as lightning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye could pierce the interior of Aramis’s room. Upon gaining this advantage D’Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor, it was a woman! D’Artagnan, however, could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her features. At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her. Then some words were spoken by the two women. At length the shutter closed.",test,1,2,0,reminded dragged feet devil could handkerchief signify could perceive face say young man entertained doubt friend held dialogue interior lady exterior prevailed prudence profiting preoccupation sight handkerchief appeared plunged two personages scene stole hiding place quick lightning stepping utmost caution ran placed close angle wall eye could pierce interior room gaining advantage near uttering cry surprise conversing nocturnal visitor woman however could see enough recognize form vestments enough distinguish features instant woman inside drew second handkerchief pocket exchanged shown words spoken two women length shutter closed
5238,"The woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed within four steps of D’Artagnan, pulling down the hood of her mantle; but the precaution was too late, D’Artagnan had already recognized Mme. Bonacieux. Mme. Bonacieux! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of D’Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket; but what probability was there that Mme. Bonacieux, who had sent for M. Laporte in order to be reconducted to the Louvre, should be running about the streets of Paris at half past eleven at night, at the risk of being abducted a second time? This must be, then, an affair of importance; and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty-five! Love. But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she exposed herself to such hazards? This was a question the young man asked himself, whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed, being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover.",test,1,2,2,woman outside window turned round passed within four steps pulling hood mantle precaution late already recognized suspicion crossed mind drew handkerchief pocket probability sent order reconducted running streets half past eleven night risk abducted second time must affair importance important affair woman twentyfive account account another exposed hazards question young man asked demon jealousy already gnawed heart neither less accepted lover
5239,"There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme. Bonacieux was going; that was to follow her. This method was so simple that D’Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively. But at the sight of the young man, who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche, and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her, Mme. Bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled. D’Artagnan ran after her. It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak. He came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street. The unfortunate woman was exhausted, not by fatigue, but by terror, and when D’Artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder, she sank upon one knee, crying in a choking voice, “Kill me, if you please, you shall know nothing! ”  D’Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist; but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting, he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness.",test,1,2,2,simple means satisfying whither going follow method simple employed quite naturally instinctively sight young man detached wall like statue walking niche noise steps heard resound behind uttered little cry fled ran difficult overtake woman embarrassed cloak came traversed third street unfortunate woman exhausted fatigue terror placed hand upon shoulder sank upon one knee crying choking voice please shall know nothing raised passing arm round waist felt weight point fainting made haste reassure protestations devotedness
5240,"These protestations were nothing for Mme. Bonacieux, for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world; but the voice was all. Mme. Bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice; she reopened her eyes, cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so, and at once perceiving it was D’Artagnan, she uttered a cry of joy, “Oh, it is you, it is you! Thank God, thank God! ”  “Yes, it is I,” said D’Artagnan, “it is I, whom God has sent to watch over you”. “Was it with that intention you followed me? ” asked the young woman, with a coquettish smile, whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence, and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy. “No,” said D’Artagnan; “no, I confess it. It was chance that threw me in your way; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends”.",test,1,2,2,protestations nothing protestations may made worst intentions world voice thought recognized sound voice reopened eyes cast quick glance upon man terrified perceiving uttered cry joy thank said sent watch intention followed asked young woman coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed influence fear disappeared moment recognized friend one taken enemy said confess chance threw way saw woman knocking window one friends

Bonacieux, who willingly took it, half laughing, half trembling, and both gained the top of Rue de la Harpe. Arriving there, the young woman seemed to hesitate, as she had before done in the Rue Vaugirard. She seemed, however, by certain signs, to recognize a door, and approaching that door, “And now, monsieur,” said she, “it is here I have business; a thousand thanks for your honorable company, which has saved me from all the dangers to which, alone, I was exposed.

Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart? ”  “Yes,” replied Mme. Bonacieux; “therefore, ask my own secrets, and I will reveal them to you; but those of others—that is quite another thing”. “Very well,” said D’Artagnan, “I shall discover them; as these secrets may have an influence over your life, these secrets must become mine”. “Beware of what you do! ” cried the young woman, in a manner so serious as to make D’Artagnan start in spite of himself. “Oh, meddle in nothing which concerns me.

Bonacieux had declared to him, by all the gods, that she did not know Aramis; and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion, he found her hanging on the arm of Aramis. D’Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer’s pretty wife for three hours; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black, who wished to carry her off, and that she had promised him nothing.

He passed them, then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine, which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge. D’Artagnan stopped before them, and they stopped before him. “What do you want, monsieur? ” demanded the Musketeer, recoiling a step, and with a foreign accent, which proved to D’Artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures. “It is not Aramis! ” cried he. “No, monsieur, it is not Aramis; and by your exclamation I perceive you have mistaken me for another, and pardon you”. “You pardon me? ” cried D’Artagnan.",test,1,1,1,determined upon course passed returned meet exactly illuminated lamp threw light part bridge stopped stopped want monsieur demanded recoiling step foreign accent proved deceived one conjectures cried monsieur exclamation perceive mistaken another pardon pardon cried

Bonacieux, in an undertone; “and now you may ruin us all”. “My Lord, Madame, I ask a hundred pardons! But I love her, my Lord, and was jealous. You know what it is to love, my Lord. Pardon me, and then tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace? ”  “You are a brave young man,” said Buckingham, holding out his hand to D’Artagnan, who pressed it respectfully. “You offer me your services; with the same frankness I accept them.

5271,"”  D’Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm, allowed the duke and Mme. Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them, ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles I.  Fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference. As for D’Artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the Pomme-de-Pin, where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him. Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance. Meanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our three friends to themselves, and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre. Chapter XII. GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM   Mme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme. Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform of the Musketeers of M. de Tréville, who, as we have said, were that evening on guard.",test,1,2,0,placed naked sword arm allowed duke take twenty steps ahead followed ready execute instructions noble elegant minister opportunity give duke proof devotion young woman handsome entered wicket without interference immediately repaired cabaret found awaiting giving explanation alarm inconvenience caused told terminated affair alone moment believed need assistance carried away narrative must leave three friends follow guide labyrinths duke entered without difficulty known belong queen duke wore uniform de said evening guard
5272,"Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen; and if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the risk upon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer? Once within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps. This space passed, Mme. Bonacieux pushed a little servants’ door, open by day but generally closed at night. The door yielded. Both entered, and found themselves in darkness; but Mme. Bonacieux was acquainted with all the turnings and windings of this part of the Louvre, appropriated for the people of the household.",test,1,1,0,interests queen anything happen would accused introduced lover took risk upon reputation would lost true value world reputation little wife mercer within interior court duke young woman followed wall space twentyfive steps space passed pushed little servants door open day generally closed night door yielded entered found darkness acquainted turnings windings part appropriated people household
5273,"She closed the door after her, took the duke by the hand, and after a few experimental steps, grasped a balustrade, put her foot upon the bottom step, and began to ascend the staircase. The duke counted two stories. She then turned to the right, followed the course of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps farther, introduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, “Remain here, my Lord Duke; someone will come”. She then went out by the same door, which she locked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner. Nevertheless, isolated as he was, we must say that the Duke of Buckingham did not experience an instant of fear. One of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance. Brave, rash, and enterprising, this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts. He had learned that the pretended message from Anne of Austria, upon the faith of which he had come to Paris, was a snare; but instead of regaining England, he had, abusing the position in which he had been placed, declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her. The queen had at first positively refused; but at length became afraid that the duke, if exasperated, would commit some folly. She had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure, when, on the very evening of coming to this decision, Mme.",test,1,2,0,closed door took duke hand experimental steps grasped balustrade put foot upon bottom step began ascend staircase duke counted two stories turned right followed course long corridor descended flight went steps farther introduced key lock opened door pushed duke apartment lighted lamp saying someone come went door locked duke found literally prisoner isolated must say experience instant fear salient points character search adventures love romance rash enterprising first time risked life attempts learned pretended message upon faith come snare instead regaining abusing position placed declared queen would depart without seeing queen first positively refused length became afraid duke exasperated would commit folly already decided upon seeing urging immediate departure evening coming decision
5274,"Bonacieux, who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the Louvre, was abducted. For two days no one knew what had become of her, and everything remained in suspense; but once free, and placed in communication with Laporte, matters resumed their course, and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which, but for her arrest, would have been executed three days earlier. Buckingham, left alone, walked toward a mirror. His Musketeer’s uniform became him marvelously. At thirty-five, which was then his age, he passed, with just title, for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or England. The favorite of two kings, immensely rich, all-powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive, in the course of centuries, to astonish posterity. Sure of himself, convinced of his own power, certain that the laws which rule other men could not reach him, he went straight to the object he aimed at, even were this object so elevated and so dazzling that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it. It was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud Anne of Austria, and in making himself loved by dazzling her. George Villiers placed himself before the glass, as we have said, restored the undulations to his beautiful hair, which the weight of his hat had disordered, twisted his mustache, and, his heart swelling with joy, happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for, he smiled upon himself with pride and hope. At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened, and a woman appeared.",test,1,3,0,charged going fetch duke conducting abducted two days one knew become everything remained suspense free placed communication matters resumed course accomplished perilous enterprise arrest would executed three days earlier left alone walked toward mirror uniform became marvelously thirtyfive age passed title handsomest gentleman elegant cavalier favorite two kings immensely rich allpowerful kingdom disordered fancy calmed caprice lived one fabulous existences survive course centuries astonish posterity convinced power certain laws rule men could reach went straight object aimed even object elevated dazzling would madness even contemplated thus succeeded approaching several times beautiful proud making loved dazzling placed glass said restored undulations beautiful hair weight hat disordered twisted mustache heart swelling joy happy proud near moment long sighed smiled upon pride hope moment door concealed tapestry opened woman appeared
5275,"Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass; he uttered a cry. It was the queen! Anne of Austria was then twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age; that is to say, she was in the full splendor of her beauty. Her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess; her eyes, which cast the brilliancy of emeralds, were perfectly beautiful, and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and majesty. Her mouth was small and rosy; and although her underlip, like that of all princes of the House of Austria, protruded slightly beyond the other, it was eminently lovely in its smile, but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt. Her skin was admired for its velvety softness; her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty, all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable. Lastly, her hair, which, from being light in her youth, had become chestnut, and which she wore curled very plainly, and with much powder, admirably set off her face, in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge, and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose. Buckingham remained for a moment dazzled. Never had Anne of Austria appeared to him so beautiful, amid balls, fêtes, or carousals, as she appeared to him at this moment, dressed in a simple robe of white satin, and accompanied by Donna Estafania—the only one of her Spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of Richelieu.

5276,"Buckingham threw himself at her feet, and before the queen could prevent him, kissed the hem of her robe. “Duke, you already know that it is not I who caused you to be written to”. “Yes, yes, madame! Yes, your Majesty! ” cried the duke. “I know that I must have been mad, senseless, to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm; but what then! They who love believe easily in love. Besides, I have lost nothing by this journey because I see you”. “Yes,” replied Anne, “but you know why and how I see you; because, insensible to all my sufferings, you persist in remaining in a city where, by remaining, you run the risk of your life, and make me run the risk of my honor. I see you to tell you that everything separates us—the depths of the sea, the enmity of kingdoms, the sanctity of vows.",test,1,1,1,threw feet queen could prevent kissed hem robe already know caused written yes madame cried duke know must mad senseless believe snow would become animated marble warm love believe easily love lost nothing journey see replied know see insensible sufferings persist remaining city remaining run risk life make run risk honor see tell everything separates us—the depths sea enmity kingdoms sanctity vows
5277,"It is sacrilege to struggle against so many things, my Lord. In short, I see you to tell you that we must never see each other again”. “Speak on, madame, speak on, Queen,” said Buckingham; “the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words. You talk of sacrilege! Why, the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by God for each other”. “My Lord,” cried the queen, “you forget that I have never said that I love you”. “But you have never told me that you did not love me; and truly, to speak such words to me would be, on the part of your Majesty, too great an ingratitude. For tell me, where can you find a love like mine—a love which neither time, nor absence, nor despair can extinguish, a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon, a stray look, or a chance word?

5278,"Mark! I see you now. You were seated upon cushions in the Spanish fashion; you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver, hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms—those lovely arms—with large diamonds. You wore a close ruff, a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe, and in that cap a heron’s feather. Hold! Hold! I shut my eyes, and I can see you as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now—a hundred times more beautiful! ”  “What folly,” murmured Anne of Austria, who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart, “what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances! ”  “And upon what then must I live? I have nothing but memory.",test,1,1,1,see seated upon cushions fashion wore robe green satin embroidered gold silver hanging sleeves knotted upon beautiful arms—those lovely arms—with large diamonds wore close ruff small cap upon head color robe cap herons feather shut eyes see open see now—a hundred times beautiful folly murmured courage find fault duke well preserved portrait heart folly feed useless passion remembrances upon must live nothing memory
5279,"It is my happiness, my treasure, my hope. Every time I see you is a fresh diamond which I enclose in the casket of my heart. This is the fourth which you have let fall and I have picked up; for in three years, madame, I have only seen you four times—the first, which I have described to you; the second, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse; the third, in the gardens of Amiens”. “Duke,” said the queen, blushing, “never speak of that evening”. “Oh, let us speak of it; on the contrary, let us speak of it! That is the most happy and brilliant evening of my life! You remember what a beautiful night it was? How soft and perfumed was the air; how lovely the blue heavens and star-enameled sky! Ah, then, madame, I was able for one instant to be alone with you.

5280,"You leaned upon my arm—upon this, madame! I felt, in bending my head toward you, your beautiful hair touch my cheek; and every time that it touched me I trembled from head to foot. Oh, Queen! Queen! You do not know what felicity from heaven, what joys from paradise, are comprised in a moment like that. Take my wealth, my fortune, my glory, all the days I have to live, for such an instant, for a night like that. For that night, madame, that night you loved me, I will swear it”. “My Lord, yes; it is possible that the influence of the place, the charm of the beautiful evening, the fascination of your look—the thousand circumstances, in short, which sometimes unite to destroy a woman—were grouped around me on that fatal evening; but, my Lord, you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered.

You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris; you believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch. What to me were all the treasures in the world, or all the kings of the earth! Eight days after, I was back again, madame. That time you had nothing to say to me; I had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second. I did not even touch your hand, and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant”. “Yes, but calumny seized upon all those follies in which I took no part, as you well know, my Lord. The king, excited by the cardinal, made a terrible clamor. Madame de Vernet was driven from me, Putange was exiled, Madame de Chevreuse fell into disgrace, and when you wished to come back as ambassador to France, the king himself—remember, my lord—the king himself opposed it”. “Yes, and France is about to pay for her king’s refusal with a war.",test,1,2,1,love mine would sunk beneath ordeal love came ardent eternal believed would fly returning believed would dare quit treasure master charged watch treasures world kings earth days back madame time nothing say risked life favor see second even touch hand pardoned seeing submissive repentant calumny seized upon follies took part well know king excited cardinal made terrible clamor de driven exiled de fell disgrace wished come back ambassador king himself—remember lord—the king opposed pay kings refusal war

They will not dare to refuse me then; and I will return to Paris, and will see you again, and will be happy for an instant. Thousands of men, it is true, will have to pay for my happiness with their lives; but what is that to me, provided I see you again! All this is perhaps folly—perhaps insanity; but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love; what queen a servant more ardent? ”  “My Lord, my Lord, you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly.

Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was less cruel than you. Holland loved her, and she responded to his love”. “Madame de Chevreuse was not queen,” murmured Anne of Austria, overcome, in spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a passion. “You would love me, then, if you were not queen!

You have told me yourself, madame, that I have been drawn into a snare; I, perhaps, may leave my life in it—for, although it may be strange, I have for some time had a presentiment that I should shortly die”. And the duke smiled, with a smile at once sad and charming. “Oh, my God! ” cried Anne of Austria, with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell. “I do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed of such dreams.",test,1,1,1,beautiful sovereign hundred times thanks ill understood wrongly interpreted mean say— silence cried duke happy error cruelty lift told madame drawn snare perhaps may leave life it—for although may strange time presentiment shortly die duke smiled smile sad charming cried accent terror proved much greater interest took duke ventured tell tell madame terrify even ridiculous name believe take heed dreams

I dreamed that I saw you lying bleeding, wounded”. “In the left side, was it not, and with a knife? ” interrupted Buckingham. “Yes, it was so, my Lord, it was so—in the left side, and with a knife.

Come back as ambassador, come back as minister, come back surrounded with guards who will defend you, with servants who will watch over you, and then I shall no longer fear for your days, and I shall be happy in seeing you”. “Oh, is this true what you say? ”  “Yes”. “Oh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from you, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you have worn, and that I may wear in my turn—a ring, a necklace, a chain”.",test,1,1,1,struck die could imagine love cause death could console run mad depart implore beautiful thus love said go implore return hereafter back ambassador come back minister come back surrounded guards defend servants watch shall longer fear days shall happy seeing true say pledge indulgence object came may remind dreaming something worn may wear turn—a ring necklace chain

Anne of Austria re-entered her apartment, and came out again almost immediately, holding a rosewood casket in her hand, with her cipher encrusted with gold. “Here, my Lord, here,” said she, “keep this in memory of me”.

Your hand, madame, your hand, and I depart! ”  Anne of Austria stretched forth her hand, closing her eyes, and leaning with the other upon Estafania, for she felt that her strength was about to fail her. Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand, and then rising, said, “Within six months, if I am not dead, I shall have seen you again, madame—even if I have to overturn the world”. And faithful to the promise he had made, he rushed out of the apartment. In the corridor he met Mme. Bonacieux, who waited for him, and who, with the same precautions and the same good luck, conducted him out of the Louvre. Chapter XIII.

5290,"This personage was M. Bonacieux, the respectable martyr of the political and amorous intrigues which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant and chivalric period. Fortunately, the reader may remember, or may not remember—fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him. The officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille, where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets. Thence, introduced into a half-subterranean gallery, he became, on the part of those who had brought him, the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment. The officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman, and they treated him like a very peasant. At the end of half an hour or thereabouts, a clerk came to put an end to his tortures, but not to his anxiety, by giving the order to conduct M. Bonacieux to the Chamber of Examination. Ordinarily, prisoners were interrogated in their cells; but they did not do so with M. Bonacieux. Two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels, opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room, where the only furniture was a table, a chair, and a commissary. The commissary was seated in the chair, and was writing at the table. The two guards led the prisoner toward the table, and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything.",test,1,3,0,personage respectable martyr political amorous intrigues entangled nicely together gallant chivalric period reader may remember may remember—fortunately promised lose sight officers arrested conducted straight passed trembling party soldiers loading muskets introduced halfsubterranean gallery became part brought object grossest insults harshest treatment officers perceived deal gentleman treated like peasant end half hour thereabouts clerk came put end tortures anxiety giving order conduct prisoners interrogated cells guards attended mercer made traverse court enter corridor three sentinels opened door pushed unceremoniously low room furniture table chair commissary commissary seated chair writing table two guards led prisoner toward table upon sign commissary drew back far unable hear anything
5291,"The commissary, who had till this time held his head down over his papers, looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with. This commissary was a man of very repulsive mien, with a pointed nose, with yellow and salient cheek bones, with eyes small but keen and penetrating, and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox. His head, supported by a long and flexible neck, issued from his large black robe, balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell. He began by asking M. Bonacieux his name, age, condition, and abode. The accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux, that he was fifty-one years old, a retired mercer, and lived Rue des Fossoyeurs, No. 14. The commissary then, instead of continuing to interrogate him, made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters. He complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal, that incomparable minister, that conqueror of past ministers, that example for ministers to come—deeds and power which none could thwart with impunity. After this second part of his discourse, fixing his hawk’s eye upon poor Bonacieux, he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation. The reflections of the mercer were already made; he cursed the instant when M. Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter, and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady of the Linen to her Majesty.",test,1,3,0,commissary till time held head papers looked see sort person commissary man repulsive mien pointed nose yellow salient cheek bones eyes small keen penetrating expression countenance resembling polecat fox head supported long flexible neck issued large black robe balancing motion much like tortoise thrusting head shell began asking name age condition abode accused replied name fiftyone years old retired mercer lived des commissary instead continuing interrogate made long speech upon danger obscure citizen meddle public matters complicated exordium exposition painted power deeds cardinal incomparable minister conqueror past ministers example ministers come—deeds power none could thwart impunity second part discourse fixing hawks eye upon poor bade reflect upon gravity situation reflections mercer already made cursed instant formed idea marrying goddaughter particularly moment goddaughter received
5292,"At bottom the character of M. Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice, the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice. The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment, and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated. Bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him. “But, Monsieur Commissary,” said he, calmly, “believe that I know and appreciate, more than anybody, the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be governed”. “Indeed? ” asked the commissary, with an air of doubt. “If that is really so, how came you in the Bastille? ”  “How I came there, or rather why I am there,” replied Bonacieux, “that is entirely impossible for me to tell you, because I don’t know myself; but to a certainty it is not for having, knowingly at least, disobliged Monsieur the Cardinal”. “You must, nevertheless, have committed a crime, since you are here and are accused of high treason”. “Of high treason!",test,1,2,0,bottom character one profound selfishness mixed sordid avarice whole seasoned extreme cowardice love young wife inspired secondary sentiment strong enough contend primitive feelings enumerated indeed reflected said said calmly know appreciate anybody merit incomparable eminence honor governed asked commissary air doubt really came came rather replied entirely impossible tell know certainty knowingly least disobliged must nevertheless committed crime since accused high treason high treason
5293,"” cried Bonacieux, terrified; “of high treason! How is it possible for a poor mercer, who detests Huguenots and who abhors Spaniards, to be accused of high treason? Consider, monsieur, the thing is absolutely impossible”. “Monsieur Bonacieux,” said the commissary, looking at the accused as if his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts, “you have a wife? ”  “Yes, monsieur,” replied the mercer, in a tremble, feeling that it was at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing; “that is to say, I _had_ one”. “What, you ‘_had_ one’? What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer? ”  “They have abducted her, monsieur”. “They have abducted her?

5294,"”  Bonacieux inferred from this “Ah” that the affair grew more and more intricate. “They have abducted her,” added the commissary; “and do you know the man who has committed this deed? ”  “I think I know him”. “Who is he? ”  “Remember that I affirm nothing, Monsieur the Commissary, and that I only suspect”. “Whom do you suspect? Come, answer freely”. M. Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible. Had he better deny everything or tell everything? By denying all, it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow; by confessing all he might prove his good will.",test,1,1,1,inferred affair grew intricate abducted added commissary know man committed deed think know affirm nothing suspect suspect answer freely greatest perplexity possible better deny everything tell everything denying might suspected must know much avow confessing might prove good

He has followed us several times, as I think, when I have waited for my wife at the wicket of the Louvre to escort her home”. The commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness. “And his name? ” said he. “Oh, as to his name, I know nothing about it; but if I were ever to meet him, I should recognize him in an instant, I will answer for it, were he among a thousand persons”.

They believe me her accomplice, and will punish me with her. She must have spoken; she must have confessed everything—a woman is so weak! A dungeon! The first he comes to! That’s it!

5298,"”  Without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of M. Bonacieux—lamentations to which, besides, they must have been pretty well accustomed—the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm, and led him away, while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting. Bonacieux could not close his eyes; not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable, but because his uneasiness was so great. He sat all night on his stool, starting at the least noise; and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber, the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints. All at once he heard his bolts drawn, and made a terrified bound. He believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold; so that when he saw merely and simply, instead of the executioner he expected, only his commissary of the preceding evening, attended by his clerk, he was ready to embrace them both. “Your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening, my good man, and I advise you to tell the whole truth; for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the cardinal”. “Why, I am ready to tell everything,” cried Bonacieux, “at least, all that I know.

Monsieur, if she has escaped, it is not my fault, I swear”. “What business had you, then, to go into the chamber of Monsieur d’Artagnan, your neighbor, with whom you had a long conference during the day? ”  “Ah, yes, Monsieur Commissary; yes, that is true, and I confess that I was in the wrong.

The two guards led in Athos. “Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the commissary, addressing Athos, “declare all that passed yesterday between you and Monsieur”. “But,” cried Bonacieux, “this is not Monsieur d’Artagnan whom you show me”. “What!

Monsieur d’Artagnan is my tenant, although he does not pay me my rent—and even better on that account ought I to know him. Monsieur d’Artagnan is a young man, scarcely nineteen or twenty, and this gentleman must be thirty at least. Monsieur d’Artagnan is in Monsieur Dessessart’s Guards, and this gentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Tréville’s Musketeers. Look at his uniform, Monsieur Commissary, look at his uniform! ”  “That’s true,” murmured the commissary; “_pardieu_, that’s true”.

Yours is a pretty business”. “But,” said the agitated mercer, “do me the pleasure, monsieur, to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while I am in prison? ”  “Because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you—of an infernal plan”.",test,1,4,1,unhappy woman cried commissary say speak wife hope contrary pretty business said agitated mercer pleasure monsieur tell proper affair become worse anything wife prison part plan concerted you—of infernal plan

Your Monsieur Bonacieux is very tiresome”. The commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux, “Let them be guarded more closely than ever”. “And yet,” said Athos, with his habitual calmness, “if it be Monsieur d’Artagnan who is concerned in this matter, I do not perceive how I can take his place”. “Do as I bade you,” cried the commissary, “and preserve absolute secrecy. You understand! ”  Athos shrugged his shoulders, and followed his guards silently, while M. Bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger.

5307,"Bonacieux wept all day, like a true mercer, not being at all a military man, as he himself informed us. In the evening, about nine o’clock, at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed, he heard steps in his corridor. These steps drew near to his dungeon, the door was thrown open, and the guards appeared. “Follow me,” said an officer, who came up behind the guards. “Follow you! ” cried Bonacieux, “follow you at this hour! Where, my God? ”  “Where we have orders to lead you”. “But that is not an answer”. “It is, nevertheless, the only one we can give”.",test,1,4,0,wept day like true mercer military man informed us evening nine clock moment made mind go bed heard steps corridor steps drew near dungeon door thrown open guards appeared said officer came behind guards cried hour orders lead answer nevertheless one give
5308,"“Ah, my God, my God! ” murmured the poor mercer, “now, indeed, I am lost! ” And he followed the guards who came for him, mechanically and without resistance. He passed along the same corridor as before, crossed one court, then a second side of a building; at length, at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback. They made him enter this carriage, the officer placed himself by his side, the door was locked, and they were left in a rolling prison. The carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car. Through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement, that was all; but, true Parisian as he was, Bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones, the signs, and the lamps. At the moment of arriving at St. Paul—the spot where such as were condemned at the Bastille were executed—he was near fainting and crossed himself twice. He thought the carriage was about to stop there. The carriage, however, passed on.",test,1,2,0,murmured poor mercer indeed lost followed guards came mechanically without resistance passed along corridor crossed one court second side building length gate entrance court found carriage surrounded four guards horseback made enter carriage officer placed side door locked left rolling prison carriage put motion slowly funeral car closely fastened windows prisoner could perceive houses pavement true could recognize every street milestones signs lamps moment arriving spot condemned executed—he near fainting crossed twice thought carriage stop carriage however passed
5309,"Farther on, a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of St. Jean, where state criminals were buried. One thing, however, reassured him; he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off, and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders. But when he saw the carriage take the way to La Grêve, when he perceived the pointed roof of the Hôtel de Ville, and the carriage passed under the arcade, he believed it was over with him. He wished to confess to the officer, and upon his refusal, uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus, he should put a gag in his mouth. This measure somewhat reassured Bonacieux. If they meant to execute him at La Grêve, it could scarcely be worth while to gag him, as they had nearly reached the place of execution. Indeed, the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping. There remained, then, no other place to fear but the Traitor’s Cross; the carriage was taking the direct road to it. This time there was no longer any doubt; it was at the Traitor’s Cross that lesser criminals were executed. Bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of St. Paul or of the Place de Grêve; it was at the Traitor’s Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end!",test,1,2,0,still greater terror seized passing cemetery state criminals buried thing however reassured remembered buried heads generally cut felt head still shoulders saw carriage take way perceived pointed roof de carriage passed arcade believed wished confess officer upon refusal uttered pitiable cries officer told continued deafen thus put gag mouth measure somewhat reassured meant execute could scarcely worth gag nearly reached place execution carriage crossed fatal spot without stopping remained place fear carriage taking direct road time longer doubt lesser criminals executed flattered believing worthy de journey destiny end
5310,"He could not yet see that dreadful cross, but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him. When he was within twenty paces of it, he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped. This was more than poor Bonacieux could endure, depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced; he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man, and fainted. Chapter XIV. THE MAN OF MEUNG   The crowd was caused, not by the expectation of a man to be hanged, but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged. The carriage, which had been stopped for a minute, resumed its way, passed through the crowd, threaded the Rue St. Honoré, turned into the Rue des Bons Enfants, and stopped before a low door. The door opened; two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported him. They carried him through an alley, up a flight of stairs, and deposited him in an antechamber. All these movements had been effected mechanically, as far as he was concerned. He had walked as one walks in a dream; he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog.",test,1,2,0,could yet see dreadful cross felt somehow coming meet within twenty paces heard noise people carriage stopped poor could endure depressed successive emotions experienced uttered feeble groan might taken last sigh dying man fainted crowd caused expectation man hanged contemplation man hanged carriage stopped minute resumed way passed crowd threaded turned des stopped low door door opened two guards received arms officer supported carried alley flight stairs deposited antechamber movements effected mechanically far concerned walked one walks dream glimpse objects fog
5311,"His ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them; he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy. He remained on the bench, with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down, exactly on the spot where the guards placed him. On looking around him, however, as he could perceive no threatening object, as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger, as the bench was comfortably covered with a well-stuffed cushion, as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful Cordova leather, and as large red damask curtains, fastened back by gold clasps, floated before the window, he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated, and he began to turn his head to the right and the left, upward and downward. At this movement, which nobody opposed, he resumed a little courage, and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other. At length, with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench, and found himself on his feet. At this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door, continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner. “Is your name Bonacieux? ” said he. “Yes, Monsieur Officer,” stammered the mercer, more dead than alive, “at your service”. “Come in,” said the officer.",test,1,2,0,ears perceived sounds without comprehending might executed moment without making single gesture defense uttering cry implore mercy remained bench back leaning wall hands hanging exactly spot guards placed looking around however could perceive threatening object nothing indicated ran real danger bench comfortably covered wellstuffed cushion wall ornamented beautiful leather large red damask curtains fastened back gold clasps floated window perceived degrees fear exaggerated began turn head right left upward downward movement nobody opposed resumed little courage ventured draw one leg length help two hands lifted bench found feet moment officer pleasant face opened door continued exchange words person next chamber came prisoner name said stammered mercer dead alive service said officer
5312,"And he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass. The latter obeyed without reply, and entered the chamber, where he appeared to be expected. It was a large cabinet, close and stifling, with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive, and in which there was already a fire, although it was scarcely the end of the month of September. A square table, covered with books and papers, upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of La Rochelle, occupied the center of the room. Standing before the chimney was a man of middle height, of a haughty, proud mien; with piercing eyes, a large brow, and a thin face, which was made still longer by a _royal_ (or _imperial_, as it is now called), surmounted by a pair of mustaches. Although this man was scarcely thirty-six or thirty-seven years of age, hair, mustaches, and royal, all began to be gray. This man, except a sword, had all the appearance of a soldier; and his buff boots, still slightly covered with dust, indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day. This man was Armand Jean Duplessis, Cardinal de Richelieu; not such as he is now represented—broken down like an old man, suffering like a martyr, his body bent, his voice failing, buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb; no longer living but by the strength of his genius, and no longer maintaining the struggle with Europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts—but such as he really was at this period; that is to say, an active and gallant cavalier, already weak of body, but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived, preparing, after having supported the Duc de Nevers in his duchy of Mantua, after having taken Nîmes, Castres, and Uzes, to drive the English from the Isle of Ré and lay siege to La Rochelle. At first sight, nothing denoted the cardinal; and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were.

5313,"“Is this that Bonacieux? ” asked he, after a moment of silence. “Yes, monseigneur,” replied the officer. “That’s well. Give me those papers, and leave us”. The officer took from the table the papers pointed out, gave them to him who asked for them, bowed to the ground, and retired. Bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the Bastille. From time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings, and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer. At the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination, the cardinal was satisfied. “That head has never conspired,” murmured he, “but it matters not; we will see”.",test,1,1,0,asked moment silence monseigneur replied officer well papers leave us officer took table papers pointed gave asked bowed ground retired recognized papers interrogatories time time man chimney raised eyes writings plunged like poniards heart poor mercer end ten minutes reading ten seconds examination cardinal satisfied head never conspired murmured matters see

The cardinal repressed a smile. “You have conspired with your wife, with Madame de Chevreuse, and with my Lord Duke of Buckingham”. “Indeed, monseigneur,” responded the mercer, “I have heard her pronounce all those names”. “And on what occasion? ”  “She said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of Buckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen”. “She said that? ” cried the cardinal, with violence. “Yes, monseigneur, but I told her she was wrong to talk about such things; and that his Eminence was incapable—”  “Hold your tongue!",test,1,2,1,accused high treason said cardinal slowly told already monseigneur cried giving interrogator title heard officer give swear know nothing cardinal repressed smile conspired wife de monseigneur responded mercer heard pronounce names occasion said de drawn ruin ruin queen said cried cardinal violence monseigneur told wrong talk things incapable— tongue

What can have become of her, then? ”  “We shall know, be assured. Nothing is concealed from the cardinal; the cardinal knows everything”. “In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife? ”  “Perhaps he may; but you must, in the first place, reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wife’s relations with Madame de Chevreuse”.",test,1,1,1,cardinal repressed another smile ignorant become wife since flight monseigneur likely returned one clock morning returned become shall know assured concealed cardinal cardinal knows everything case monseigneur believe cardinal kind tell become wife may must first place reveal cardinal know wifes relations de

Tell him to come to me immediately, if he has returned”. “The count is here,” said the officer, “and requests to speak with your Eminence instantly”. “Let him come in, then! ” said the cardinal, quickly.

The officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the antechamber, where he found his two guards.

Bonacieux was introduced afresh, and upon a sign from the cardinal, the officer retired. “You have deceived me! ” said the cardinal, sternly. “I,” cried Bonacieux, “I deceive your Eminence! ”  “Your wife, in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe, did not go to find linen drapers”. “Then why did she go, just God? ”  “She went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of Buckingham”. “Yes,” cried Bonacieux, recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances, “yes, that’s it.

I have touched the hand of the great man! ” cried Bonacieux. “The great man has called me his friend! ”  “Yes, my friend, yes,” said the cardinal, with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume, but which deceived none who knew him; “and as you have been unjustly suspected, well, you must be indemnified.

Pardon you, monseigneur! You cannot mean that! ”  “Ah, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, you are generous in this matter. I see it and I thank you for it. Thus, then, you will take this bag, and you will go away without being too malcontent”. “I go away enchanted”. “Farewell, then, or rather, _au revoir_, for I hope we shall meet again”. “Whenever Monseigneur wishes, I am always at at his Eminence’s orders”.",test,1,1,1,said hesitating take purse fearing doubtless pretended gift pleasantry able arrested able tortured able hanged master could least word say monseigneur mean dear generous matter see thank take bag go away without malcontent go away enchanted rather revoir hope shall meet wishes always orders

Monseigneur! ”  “_Au revoir_, Monsieur Bonacieux, _au revoir! _”  And the cardinal made him a sign with his hand, to which Bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground. He then went out backward, and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him, in his enthusiasm, crying aloud, “Long life to the Monseigneur! Long life to his Eminence! Long life to the great cardinal! ” The cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of M. Bonacieux; and then, when Bonacieux’s cries were no longer audible, “Good! ” said he, “that man would henceforward lay down his life for me”.",test,1,1,0,frequently assure found something extremely agreeable conversation revoir revoir cardinal made sign hand replied bowing ground went backward antechamber cardinal heard enthusiasm crying aloud life life life great cardinal cardinal listened smile vociferous manifestation feelings cries longer audible said man would henceforward lay life

As he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations, the door opened, and Rochefort returned. “Well? ” said the cardinal, eagerly, rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count. “Well,” said the latter, “a young woman of about twenty-six or twenty-eight years of age, and a man of from thirty-five to forty, have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your Eminence; but the woman left last night, and the man this morning”. “It was they! ” cried the cardinal, looking at the clock; “and now it is too late to have them pursued.

5335,"The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great, and retired. Left alone, the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter, which he secured with his special seal. Then he rang. The officer entered for the fourth time. “Tell Vitray to come to me,” said he, “and tell him to get ready for a journey”. An instant after, the man he asked for was before him, booted and spurred. “Vitray,” said he, “you will go with all speed to London. You must not stop an instant on the way.

The messenger, without replying a single word, bowed, took the letter, with the order for the two hundred pistoles, and retired. Here is what the letter contained:  MILADY, Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be present. He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs; get as near to him as you can, and cut off two. As soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me. Chapter XV. MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD   On the day after these events had taken place, Athos not having reappeared, M. de Tréville was informed by D’Artagnan and Porthos of the circumstance. As to Aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for five days, and was gone, it was said, to Rouen on family business. M. de Tréville was the father of his soldiers. The lowest or the least known of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.",test,1,2,0,shall much back within six days executed commission well messenger without replying single word bowed took letter order two hundred pistoles retired letter contained first ball shall present wear doublet twelve diamond studs get near cut two soon studs shall possession inform day events taken place reappeared de informed circumstance asked leave absence five days gone said family business de father soldiers lowest least known soon assumed uniform company sure aid support brother
5337,"He repaired, then, instantly to the office of the _lieutenant-criminel_. The officer who commanded the post of the Red Cross was sent for, and by successive inquiries they learned that Athos was then lodged in Fort l’Evêque. Athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux undergo. We were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other. Athos, who had till that time said nothing for fear that D’Artagnan, interrupted in his turn, should not have the time necessary, from this moment declared that his name was Athos, and not D’Artagnan. He added that he did not know either M. or Mme. Bonacieux; that he had never spoken to the one or the other; that he had come, at about ten o’clock in the evening, to pay a visit to his friend M. d’Artagnan, but that till that hour he had been at M. de Tréville’s, where he had dined. “Twenty witnesses,” added he, “could attest the fact”; and he named several distinguished gentlemen, and among them was M. le Duc de la Trémouille. The second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the Musketeer, upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword; but the name of M. de Tréville, and that of M. de la Trémouille, commanded a little reflection.

5338,"It was precisely at this moment that M. de Tréville, on leaving the residence of the _lieutenant-criminel_ and the governor of Fort l’Evêque without being able to find Athos, arrived at the palace. As captain of the Musketeers, M. de Tréville had the right of entry at all times. It is well known how violent the king’s prejudices were against the queen, and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal, who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men. One of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of Austria for Mme. de Chevreuse. These two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with Spain, the quarrel with England, or the embarrassment of the finances. In his eyes and to his conviction, Mme. de Chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues, but, what tormented him still more, in her amorous intrigues. At the first word the cardinal spoke of Mme. de Chevreuse—who, though exiled to Tours and believed to be in that city, had come to Paris, remained there five days, and outwitted the police—the king flew into a furious passion.",test,1,2,0,precisely moment de leaving residence governor levêque without able find arrived palace captain de right entry times well known violent kings prejudices queen carefully prejudices kept cardinal affairs intrigue mistrusted women infinitely men grand causes prejudice friendship de two women gave uneasiness war quarrel embarrassment finances eyes conviction de served queen political intrigues tormented still amorous intrigues first word cardinal spoke de though exiled believed city come remained five days outwitted police—the king flew furious passion
5339,"Capricious and unfaithful, the king wished to be called Louis the Just and Louis the Chaste. Posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character, which history explains only by facts and never by reason. But when the cardinal added that not only Mme. de Chevreuse had been in Paris, but still further, that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a _cabal;_ when he affirmed that he, the cardinal, was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue; that at the moment of arresting in the very act, with all the proofs about her, the queen’s emissary to the exiled duchess, a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently, by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law, charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king—Louis XIII. could not contain himself, and he made a step toward the queen’s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which, when it broke out, led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty. And yet, in all this, the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of Buckingham. At this instant M. de Tréville entered, cool, polite, and in irreproachable costume. Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king’s countenance, M. de Tréville felt himself something like Samson before the Philistines. Louis XIII. had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the noise of M. de Tréville’s entrance he turned round.",test,1,3,0,unfaithful king wished called find difficulty understanding character history explains facts never reason cardinal added de still queen renewed one mysterious correspondences time named affirmed cardinal unravel closely twisted thread intrigue moment arresting act proofs queens emissary exiled duchess dared interrupt course justice violently falling sword hand upon honest men law charged investigating impartially whole affair order place eyes king—louis could contain made step toward queens apartment pale mute indignation broke led prince commission pitiless cruelty yet cardinal yet said word instant de entered cool polite irreproachable costume passed presence cardinal alteration kings countenance de felt something like already placed hand knob door noise de entrance turned round
5340,"“You arrive in good time, monsieur,” said the king, who, when his passions were raised to a certain point, could not dissemble; “I have learned some fine things concerning your Musketeers”. “And I,” said Tréville, coldly, “I have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gownsmen”. “What? ” said the king, with hauteur. “I have the honor to inform your Majesty,” continued M. de Tréville, in the same tone, “that a party of _procureurs_, commissaries, and men of the police—very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears, against the uniform—have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to lead away through the open street, and throw into Fort l’Evêque, all upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost illustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur Athos”. “Athos,” said the king, mechanically; “yes, certainly I know that name”. “Let your Majesty remember,” said Tréville, “that Monsieur Athos is the Musketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously. _A propos_, monseigneur,” continued Tréville, addressing the cardinal, “Monsieur de Cahusac is quite recovered, is he not? ”  “Thank you,” said the cardinal, biting his lips with anger. “Athos, then, went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time,” continued Tréville, “to a young Béarnais, a cadet in his Majesty’s Guards, the company of Monsieur Dessessart, but scarcely had he arrived at his friend’s and taken up a book, while waiting his return, when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house, broke open several doors—”  The cardinal made the king a sign, which signified, “That was on account of the affair about which I spoke to you”.",test,1,3,0,arrive good time monsieur said king passions raised certain point could dissemble learned fine things concerning said coldly pretty things tell concerning gownsmen said king hauteur honor inform continued de tone party commissaries men police—very estimable people inveterate appears uniform—have taken upon arrest house lead away open street throw levêque upon order refused show one rather sire irreproachable conduct almost illustrious reputation knows favorably said king mechanically certainly know name remember said annoying duel acquainted misfortune wound de seriously propos monseigneur continued addressing cardinal de quite recovered said cardinal biting lips anger went pay visit one friends absent time continued young cadet company scarcely arrived friends taken book waiting return mixed crowd bailiffs soldiers came laid siege house broke open several doors— cardinal made king sign signified account affair spoke
5341,"“We all know that,” interrupted the king; “for all that was done for our service”. “Then,” said Tréville, “it was also for your Majesty’s service that one of my Musketeers, who was innocent, has been seized, that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor, and that this gallant man, who has ten times shed his blood in your Majesty’s service and is ready to shed it again, has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace? ”  “Bah! ” said the king, who began to be shaken, “was it so managed? ”  “Monsieur de Tréville,” said the cardinal, with the greatest phlegm, “does not tell your Majesty that this innocent Musketeer, this gallant man, had only an hour before attacked, sword in hand, four commissaries of inquiry, who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance”. “I defy your Eminence to prove it,” cried Tréville, with his Gascon freedom and military frankness; “for one hour before, Monsieur Athos, who, I will confide it to your Majesty, is really a man of the highest quality, did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel, with the Duc de la Trémouille and the Comte de Châlus, who happened to be there”. The king looked at the cardinal. “A written examination attests it,” said the cardinal, replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his Majesty; “and the ill-treated people have drawn up the following, which I have the honor to present to your Majesty”. “And is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman? ” replied Tréville haughtily.",test,1,3,0,know interrupted king done service said also service one innocent seized placed two guards like malefactor gallant man ten times shed blood service ready shed paraded midst insolent populace said king began shaken managed de said cardinal greatest phlegm tell innocent gallant man hour attacked sword hand four commissaries inquiry delegated examine affair highest importance defy prove cried freedom military frankness one hour confide really man highest quality honor dined conversing saloon hôtel de la de happened king looked cardinal written examination attests said cardinal replying aloud mute interrogation illtreated people drawn following honor present written report gownsmen placed comparison word honor swordsman replied haughtily

The house may be suspected; but I deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d’Artagnan, for I can affirm, sire, if I can believe what he says, that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your Majesty, or a more profound admirer of Monsieur the Cardinal”. “Was it not this D’Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day, in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the Carmes-Déchaussés? ” asked the king, looking at the cardinal, who colored with vexation. “And the next day, Bernajoux.

The army, I will answer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs”.

It appears, according to your account, that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested, France is in danger. What a noise about a Musketeer! I would arrest ten of them, _ventrebleu_, a hundred, even, all the company, and I would not allow a whisper”. “From the moment they are suspected by your Majesty,” said Tréville, “the Musketeers are guilty; therefore, you see me prepared to surrender my sword—for after having accused my soldiers, there can be no doubt that Monsieur the Cardinal will end by accusing me.

The king feared an outbreak. “If his Eminence,” said he, “did not have personal motives—”  The cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him:  “Pardon me,” said he; “but the instant your Majesty considers me a prejudiced judge, I withdraw”. “Come,” said the king, “will you swear, by my father, that Athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it? ”  “By your glorious father, and by yourself, whom I love and venerate above all the world, I swear it”. “Be so kind as to reflect, sire,” said the cardinal. “If we release the prisoner thus, we shall never know the truth”.",test,1,2,0,said king replied without lowering voice least order restored let tried shall tried said cardinal much better case shall demand permission plead king feared outbreak said personal motives— cardinal saw king say interrupted said instant considers prejudiced judge withdraw said king swear father residence event took part glorious father love venerate world swear kind reflect sire said cardinal release prisoner thus shall never know truth

He will not desert, Monsieur the Cardinal, be assured of that; I will answer for him”. “No, he will not desert,” said the king; “he can always be found, as Tréville says. Besides,” added he, lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal, “let us give them apparent security; that is policy”. This policy of Louis XIII. made Richelieu smile. “Order it as you please, sire; you possess the right of pardon”. “The right of pardoning only applies to the guilty,” said Tréville, who was determined to have the last word, “and my Musketeer is innocent. It is not mercy, then, that you are about to accord, sire, it is justice”. “And he is in the Fort l’Evêque?",test,1,1,0,may always found replied answer shall please gownsmen interrogate desert assured answer desert said king always found says added lowering voice looking suppliant air cardinal us give apparent security policy policy made smile please sire possess right pardon right pardoning applies guilty said determined last word innocent mercy accord sire justice levêque

Tréville bowed very respectfully, with a joy that was not unmixed with fear; he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding. The king signed the order for release, and Tréville carried it away without delay. As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave him a friendly smile, and said, “A perfect harmony reigns, sire, between the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all”. “He will play me some dog’s trick or other, and that immediately,” said Tréville.",test,1,2,0,said king sire solitary confinement dungeon like lowest criminal devil murmured king must done order release said replied cardinal believe de guarantee sufficient bowed respectfully joy unmixed fear would preferred obstinate resistance part cardinal sudden yielding king signed order release carried away without delay leave presence cardinal gave friendly smile said perfect harmony reigns sire leaders soldiers must profitable service honorable play dogs trick immediately said

But let us be quick—the king may change his mind in an hour; and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the Fort l’Evêque or the Bastille who has got out, than to keep a prisoner there who is in”. M. de Tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the Fort l’Evêque, whence he delivered the Musketeer, whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him. The first time he saw D’Artagnan, “You have come off well,” said he to him; “there is your Jussac thrust paid for. There still remains that of Bernajoux, but you must not be too confident”. As to the rest, M. de Tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over, for scarcely had the captain of the Musketeers closed the door after him, than his Eminence said to the king, “Now that we are at length by ourselves, we will, if your Majesty pleases, converse seriously. Sire, Buckingham has been in Paris five days, and only left this morning”. Chapter XVI. IN WHICH M.

To conspire against my honor with Madame de Chevreuse, Madame de Longueville, and the Condés”. “Oh, sire, what an idea! The queen is too virtuous; and besides, loves your Majesty too well”. “Woman is weak, Monsieur Cardinal,” said the king; “and as to loving me much, I have my own opinion as to that love”. “I not the less maintain,” said the cardinal, “that the Duke of Buckingham came to Paris for a project wholly political”. “And I am sure that he came for quite another purpose, Monsieur Cardinal; but if the queen be guilty, let her tremble!",test,1,1,1,cried come conspire doubt enemies conspire honor de de sire idea queen virtuous besides loves well weak said king loving much opinion love less maintain said cardinal came project wholly political sure came quite another purpose queen guilty let tremble

These thoughts, gilded as they were by a last reflection of love, were not the less sad.

All the ladies rose, and there was a profound silence. As to the king, he made no demonstration of politeness, only stopping before the queen. “Madame,” said he, “you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor, who will communicate certain matters to you with which I have charged him”.

When the chancellor appeared, the king had already gone out by another door. The chancellor entered, half smiling, half blushing. As we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history, it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him. This chancellor was a pleasant man. He was Des Roches le Masle, canon of Notre Dame, who had formerly been valet of a bishop, who introduced him to his Eminence as a perfectly devout man. The cardinal trusted him, and therein found his advantage. There are many stories related of him, and among them this. After a wild youth, he had retired into a convent, there to expiate, at least for some time, the follies of adolescence. On entering this holy place, the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him.",test,1,2,0,king turned upon heel without reply almost instant captain de announced visit chancellor chancellor appeared king already gone another door chancellor entered half smiling half blushing shall probably meet course history may well readers made acquainted chancellor pleasant man le canon formerly valet bishop introduced perfectly devout man cardinal trusted therein found advantage many stories related among wild youth retired convent expiate least time follies adolescence entering holy place poor penitent unable shut door close prevent passions fled entering
5362,"He was incessantly attacked by them, and the superior, to whom he had confided this misfortune, wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them, had advised him, in order to conjure away the tempting demon, to have recourse to the bell rope, and ring with all his might. At the denunciating sound, the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother, and all the community would go to prayers. This advice appeared good to the future chancellor. He conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks. But the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison. In proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations; so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing, announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced. The monks had no longer an instant of repose. By day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel; at night, in addition to complines and matins, they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells. It is not known whether it was the devil who gave way, or the monks who grew tired; but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible _possessed_ that ever existed. On leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy, became president on the place of his uncle, embraced the cardinal’s party, which did not prove want of sagacity, became chancellor, served his Eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen-mother and his vengeance against Anne of Austria, stimulated the judges in the affair of Calais, encouraged the attempts of M. de Laffemas, chief gamekeeper of France; then, at length, invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal—a confidence which he had so well earned—he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen’s apartments.",test,1,3,0,incessantly attacked superior confided misfortune wishing much lay free advised order conjure away tempting demon recourse bell rope ring might denunciating sound monks would rendered aware temptation besieging brother community would go prayers advice appeared good future chancellor conjured evil spirit abundance prayers offered monks devil suffer easily dispossessed place fixed garrison proportion redoubled exorcisms redoubled temptations day night bell ringing full swing announcing extreme desire mortification penitent experienced monks longer instant repose day nothing ascend descend steps led chapel night addition complines matins obliged leap twenty times beds prostrate floor cells known whether devil gave way monks grew tired within three months penitent reappeared world reputation terrible ever existed leaving convent entered magistracy became president place uncle embraced cardinals party prove want sagacity became chancellor served zeal hatred queenmother vengeance stimulated judges affair encouraged attempts de chief gamekeeper length invested entire confidence cardinal—a confidence well earned—he received singular commission execution presented queens apartments

5364,"When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries, it became necessary, whatever hesitation he might experience—it became necessary, I say, to come to the conclusion of the affair; that is to say, to search the queen herself. The chancellor advanced, therefore, toward Anne of Austria, and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air, “And now it remains for me to make the principal examination”. “What is that? ” asked the queen, who did not understand, or rather was not willing to understand. “His majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day; he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address. This letter is not in your table nor in your secretary; and yet this letter must be somewhere”. “Would you dare to lift your hand to your queen? ” said Anne of Austria, drawing herself up to her full height, and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening. “I am a faithful subject of the king, madame, and all that his Majesty commands I shall do”. “Well, it is true!",test,1,2,0,chancellor opened shut twenty times drawers secretaries became necessary whatever hesitation might experience—it became necessary say come conclusion affair say search queen chancellor advanced therefore toward said perplexed embarrassed air remains make principal examination asked queen understand rather willing understand majesty certain letter written day knows yet sent address letter table secretary yet letter must somewhere dare lift hand queen said drawing full height fixing eyes upon chancellor expression almost threatening faithful subject king madame commands shall true

And the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom. “Then give me that letter, madame,” said the chancellor. “I will give it to none but the king, monsieur,” said Anne. “If the king had desired that the letter should be given to him, madame, he would have demanded it of you himself.

5367,"” cried the queen, in whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to rise. The chancellor made a profound reverence. Then, with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged, and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture, he approached Anne of Austria, from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage. The queen was, as we have said, of great beauty. The commission might well be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of Buckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else. Without doubt the chancellor Séguier looked about at that moment for the rope of the famous bell; but not finding it he summoned his resolution, and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had acknowledged the paper was to be found. Anne of Austria took one step backward, became so pale that it might be said she was dying, and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind her to keep herself from falling, she with her right hand drew the paper from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals. “There, monsieur, there is that letter! ” cried the queen, with a broken and trembling voice; “take it, and deliver me from your odious presence”.

5368,"The door was scarcely closed upon him, when the queen sank, half fainting, into the arms of her women. The chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of it. The king took it with a trembling hand, looked for the address, which was wanting, became very pale, opened it slowly, then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of Spain, he read it rapidly. It was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal. The queen pressed her brother and the Emperor of Austria to appear to be wounded, as they really were, by the policy of Richelieu—the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of Austria—to declare war against France, and as a condition of peace, to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal; but as to love, there was not a single word about it in all the letter. The king, quite delighted, inquired if the cardinal was still at the Louvre; he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty in the business cabinet. The king went straight to him. “There, Duke,” said he, “you were right and I was wrong. The whole intrigue is political, and there is not the least question of love in this letter; but, on the other hand, there is abundant question of you”.

I say that according to all probability I shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of La Rochelle, and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either Monsieur de Condé, Monsieur de Bassopierre, or some valiant gentleman whose business is war, and not me, who am a churchman, and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which I have no aptitude. You would be the happier for it at home, sire, and I do not doubt you would be the greater for it abroad”. “Monsieur Duke,” said the king, “I understand you.

And even if she were to be seriously offended, I could well understand it; your Majesty has treated her with a severity—”  “It is thus I will always treat my enemies and yours, Duke, however high they may be placed, and whatever peril I may incur in acting severely toward them”. “The queen is my enemy, but is not yours, sire; on the contrary, she is a devoted, submissive, and irreproachable wife.

5372,"I will answer for it, her resentment will not hold out against such an attention”. “Monsieur Cardinal, you know that I do not like worldly pleasures”. “The queen will only be the more grateful to you, as she knows your antipathy for that amusement; besides, it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself”. “We shall see, Monsieur Cardinal, we shall see,” said the king, who, in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about, and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread, was ready to make up all differences with her, “we shall see, but upon my honor, you are too indulgent toward her”. “Sire,” said the cardinal, “leave severity to your ministers. Clemency is a royal virtue; employ it, and you will find that you derive advantage therein”. Thereupon the cardinal, hearing the clock strike eleven, bowed low, asking permission of the king to retire, and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen. Anne of Austria, who, in consequence of the seizure of her letter, expected reproaches, was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with her. Her first movement was repellent.

5373,"The king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fête. A fête was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this announcement, as the cardinal had predicted, the last trace of her resentment disappeared, if not from her heart, at least from her countenance. She asked upon what day this fête would take place, but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head. Indeed, every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place; and every day the cardinal, under some pretext, deferred fixing it. Ten days passed away thus. On the eighth day after the scene we have described, the cardinal received a letter with the London stamp which only contained these lines: “I have them; but I am unable to leave London for want of money. Send me five hundred pistoles, and four or five days after I have received them I shall be in Paris”. On the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him. Richelieu counted on his fingers, and said to himself, “She will arrive, she says, four or five days after having received the money. It will require four or five days for the transmission of the money, four or five days for her to return; that makes ten days.",test,1,2,0,king took advantage favorable moment tell intention shortly giving fête fête rare thing poor announcement cardinal predicted last trace resentment disappeared heart least countenance asked upon day fête would take place king replied must consult cardinal upon head every day king asked cardinal fête take place every day cardinal pretext deferred fixing days passed away thus eighth day scene described cardinal received letter stamp contained lines unable leave want money five hundred pistoles four five days received shall day cardinal received letter king put customary question counted fingers said arrive says four five days received money require four five days transmission money four five days return makes ten days

Today is the twentieth of September. The aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of October. That will fall in wonderfully well; you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the queen”. Then the cardinal added, “_A propos_, sire, do not forget to tell her Majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her diamond studs become her”. Chapter XVII.

More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal, whose police, without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police, were excellent, being better informed than himself, even upon what was going on in his own household. He hoped, then, in a conversation with Anne of Austria, to obtain some information from that conversation, and afterward to come upon his Eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know, but which, in either case, would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister. He went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her. Anne of Austria lowered her head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that it would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII. meant. Louis XIII. wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break, convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence was so skillful in getting up. He arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation. “But,” cried Anne of Austria, tired of these vague attacks, “but, sire, you do not tell me all that you have in your heart.",test,1,2,0,struck insistence began fancy recommendation concealed mystery king humiliated cardinal whose police without yet attained perfection modern police excellent better informed even upon going household hoped conversation obtain information conversation afterward come upon secret cardinal either knew know either case would raise infinitely eyes minister went queen according custom accosted fresh menaces surrounded lowered head allowed torrent flow without replying hoping would cease meant wanted discussion light might break convinced cardinal afterthought preparing one terrible surprises skillful getting arrived end persistence accusation cried tired vague attacks sire tell heart

The king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer; and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête. “Madame,” said he, with dignity, “there will shortly be a ball at the Hôtel de Ville. I wish, in order to honor our worthy aldermen, you should appear in ceremonial costume, and above all, ornamented with the diamond studs which I gave you on your birthday. That is my answer”.

Is there any crime in this request? ”  “No, sire”. “Then you will appear? ”  “Yes, sire”. “That is well,” said the king, retiring, “that is well; I count upon it”. The queen made a curtsy, less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her.

Buckingham had returned to London; Mme. de Chevreuse was at Tours. More closely watched than ever, the queen felt certain, without knowing how to tell which, that one of her women had betrayed her. Laporte could not leave the Louvre; she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide. Thus, while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left, she broke out into sobs and tears. “Can I be of service to your Majesty?",test,1,1,2,lost knelt upon cushion prayed head buried palpitating arms fact position terrible returned de closely watched ever queen felt certain without knowing tell one women betrayed could leave soul world could confide contemplating misfortune threatened abandonment left broke sobs tears service
5381,"” said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity. The queen turned sharply round, for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice; it was a friend who spoke thus. In fact, at one of the doors which opened into the queen’s apartment appeared the pretty Mme. Bonacieux. She had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered; she could not get out and had heard all. The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised—for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laporte. “Oh, fear nothing, madame! ” said the young woman, clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queen’s sorrows; “I am your Majesty’s, body and soul, and however far I may be from you, however inferior may be my position, I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your Majesty from your trouble”. “You, oh, heaven, you! ” cried the queen; “but look me in the face.",test,1,1,2,said voice full sweetness pity queen turned sharply round could deception expression voice friend spoke thus fact one doors opened queens apartment appeared pretty engaged arranging dresses linen closet king entered could get heard queen uttered piercing cry finding surprised—for trouble first recognize young woman given fear nothing madame said young woman clasping hands weeping queens sorrows body soul however far may however inferior may position believe discovered means extricating trouble oh heaven cried queen look face
5382,"I am betrayed on all sides. Can I trust in you? ”  “Oh, madame! ” cried the young woman, falling on her knees; “upon my soul, I am ready to die for your Majesty! ”  This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart, and, like the first, there was no mistaking it. “Yes,” continued Mme. Bonacieux, “yes, there are traitors here; but by the holy name of the Virgin, I swear that no one is more devoted to your Majesty than I am.

He will set out upon receiving an order from me, without knowing what he carries, and he will carry your Majesty’s letter, without even knowing it is from your Majesty, to the address which is on it”. The queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion, gazed at her as if to read her very heart, and, seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes, embraced her tenderly. “Do that,” cried she, “and you will have saved my life, you will have saved my honor! ”  “Do not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your Majesty.",test,1,1,2,least means husband liberty two three days yet time see worthy honest man entertains neither love hatred anybody anything wish set upon receiving order without knowing carries carry letter without even knowing address queen took two hands young woman burst emotion gazed read heart seeing nothing sincerity beautiful eyes embraced tenderly cried saved life saved honor exaggerate service happiness render

Is that what you would say? ”  “He has some, but he is very avaricious; that is his fault. Nevertheless, let not your Majesty be uneasy, we will find means”. “And I have none, either,” said the queen.

5389,"Mme. Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird. Ten minutes afterward she was at home. As she told the queen, she had not seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal—a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the Comte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux, and had persuaded him, without much trouble, that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife, but that it was only a political precaution. She found M. Bonacieux alone; the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house, in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied—justice not being one of the three things which King Solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage. As to the servant, she had run away at the moment of her master’s arrest. Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy, her native place. The worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed his wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by congratulating him, and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit. This first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other circumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but he had, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits Rochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody knows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection.

5390,"Rochefort called him his friend, his dear Bonacieux, and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him. The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune. On her side Mme. Bonacieux had also reflected; but, it must be admitted, upon something widely different from ambition. In spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love. Married at eighteen to M. Bonacieux, having always lived among her husband’s friends—people little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her position—Mme. Bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions; but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class, and D’Artagnan was a gentleman. Besides, he wore the uniform of the Guards, which, next to that of the Musketeers, was most admired by the ladies. He was, we repeat, handsome, young, and bold; he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return.

The couple, then, although they had not seen each other for eight days, and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned, accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation. Nevertheless, Bonacieux manifested real joy, and advanced toward his wife with open arms. Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to him. “Let us talk a little,” said she. “How! ” said Bonacieux, astonished. “Yes, I have something of the highest importance to tell you”. “True,” said he, “and I have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you.

Bonacieux. “And what does it concern, then—my captivity? ”  “I heard of it the day it happened; but as you were not guilty of any crime, as you were not guilty of any intrigue, as you, in short, knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else, I attached no more importance to that event than it merited”. “You speak very much at your ease, madame,” said Bonacieux, hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him. “Do you know that I was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the Bastille? ”  “Oh, a day and night soon pass away.

But a man, were he even a mercer, when he had talked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu, is no longer the same man. “Much money to be gained? ” said Bonacieux, protruding his lip. “Yes, much”. “About how much? ”  “A thousand pistoles, perhaps”. “What you demand of me is serious, then? ”  “It is indeed”. “What must be done?",test,1,4,1,knew talking money husband took weak side man even mercer talked ten minutes longer man money gained said protruding lip much much thousand pistoles perhaps demand serious indeed must done

Fortunately we have the great cardinal; his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart”. Bonacieux was repeating, word for word, a sentence which he had heard from the Comte de Rochefort; but the poor wife, who had reckoned on her husband, and who, in that hope, had answered for him to the queen, did not tremble the less, both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced.

But the more the young woman excused herself, the more important Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him. He resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de Rochefort, and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to London. “Pardon me for quitting you, my dear Madame Bonacieux,” said he; “but, not knowing you would come to see me, I had made an engagement with a friend. I shall soon return; and if you will wait only a few minutes for me, as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend, as it is growing late, I will come back and reconduct you to the Louvre”. “Thank you, monsieur, you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever,” replied Mme.

Porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that evening borrowed Planchet. As to D’Artagnan, he took care not to give the least sign of existence.

An opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired, and money to be gained; and as a far higher encouragement, it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored. This chance did, then, for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of Providence. M. de Tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen. D’Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance.

Still further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance. This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful. D’Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy.

When well assured this search was superfluous, he followed D’Artagnan, wondering to himself how this young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had become of her. Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of D’Artagnan, and looking at him earnestly, “You have not spoken of this lady? ” said he. “To nobody in the world”. “Not even to Athos or Porthos? ”  “I have not breathed a syllable to them”.",test,1,1,0,asked events best follow us called ordered join residence said us go time taking cloak sword three pistols opening uselessly two three drawers see could find stray coin well assured search superfluous followed wondering young know well lady given hospitality know better become went placed hand upon arm looking earnestly spoken lady said nobody world even breathed syllable

So let us go and get killed where we are told to go. Is life worth the trouble of so many questions? D’Artagnan, I am ready to follow you”. “And I also,” said Porthos. “And I also,” said Aramis. “And, indeed, I am not sorry to quit Paris; I had need of distraction”. “Well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured,” said D’Artagnan. “And, now, when are we to go? ” asked Athos.",test,1,1,1,right said three leaves absence came de three hundred pistoles came know let us go get killed told go life worth trouble many questions ready follow also said also said indeed sorry quit need distraction distractions enough gentlemen assured said go asked
5452,"“Immediately,” replied D’Artagnan; “we have not a minute to lose”. “Hello, Grimaud! Planchet! Mousqueton! Bazin! ” cried the four young men, calling their lackeys, “clean my boots, and fetch the horses from the hôtel”. Each Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel, as at a barrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. Planchet, Grimaud, Mousqueton, and Bazin set off at full speed. “Now let us lay down the plan of campaign,” said Porthos. “Where do we go first?",test,1,1,0,replied minute lose cried four young men calling lackeys boots fetch horses hôtel accustomed leave general hôtel barrack horse lackey set full speed let us lay plan campaign said go first

D’Artagnan will give each of us his instructions. I will go by the way of Boulogne to clear the way; Athos will set out two hours after, by that of Amiens; Aramis will follow us by that of Noyon; as to D’Artagnan, he will go by what route he thinks is best, in Planchet’s clothes, while Planchet will follow us like D’Artagnan, in the uniform of the Guards”. “Gentlemen,” said Athos, “my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. A secret may, by chance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by lackeys”. “Porthos’s plan appears to me to be impracticable,” said D’Artagnan, “inasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give you. I am the bearer of a letter, that is all.

5454,"We must, then, as it appears to me, travel in company. This letter is here, in this pocket,” and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter. “If I should be killed, one of you must take it, and continue the route; if he be killed, it will be another’s turn, and so on—provided a single one arrives, that is all that is required”. “Bravo, D’Artagnan, your opinion is mine,” cried Athos, “Besides, we must be consistent; I am going to take the waters, you will accompany me. Instead of taking the waters of Forges, I go and take sea waters; I am free to do so. If anyone wishes to stop us, I will show Monsieur de Tréville’s letter, and you will show your leaves of absence. If we are attacked, we will defend ourselves; if we are tried, we will stoutly maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of times in the sea. They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men; whereas four men together make a troop. We will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons; if they send an army out against us, we will give battle, and the survivor, as D’Artagnan says, will carry the letter”. “Well said,” cried Aramis; “you don’t often speak, Athos, but when you do speak, it is like St. John of the Golden Mouth.",test,1,2,1,must appears travel company letter pocket pointed pocket contained letter killed one must take continue route killed anothers turn on—provided single one arrives required opinion mine cried must consistent going take waters accompany taking waters go take sea waters free anyone wishes stop us show de letter show leaves absence attacked defend tried stoutly maintain anxious dip certain number times sea would easy bargain four isolated men whereas four men together make troop arm four lackeys pistols musketoons send army us give battle survivor says carry letter said cried often speak speak like

D’Artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of the enterprise; let him decide, and we will execute”. “Well,” said D’Artagnan, “I decide that we should adopt Athos’s plan, and that we set off in half an hour”. “Agreed! ” shouted the three Musketeers in chorus.

5456,"As long as it was dark they remained silent; in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity, and apprehended ambushes on every side. With the first rays of day their tongues were loosened; with the sun gaiety revived. It was like the eve of a battle; the heart beat, the eyes laughed, and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose, was, after all, a good thing. Besides, the appearance of the caravan was formidable. The black horses of the Musketeers, their martial carriage, with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier, would have betrayed the most strict incognito. The lackeys followed, armed to the teeth. All went well till they arrived at Chantilly, which they reached about eight o’clock in the morning. They needed breakfast, and alighted at the door of an _auberge_, recommended by a sign representing St. Martin giving half his cloak to a poor man. They ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses, and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately. They entered the common hall, and placed themselves at table.",test,1,2,0,long dark remained silent spite submitted influence obscurity apprehended ambushes every side first rays day tongues loosened sun gaiety revived like eve battle heart beat eyes laughed felt life perhaps going lose good thing appearance caravan formidable black horses martial carriage regimental step noble companions soldier would betrayed strict incognito lackeys followed armed teeth went well till arrived reached eight clock morning needed breakfast alighted door recommended sign representing giving half cloak poor man ordered lackeys unsaddle horses hold readiness set immediately entered common hall placed table
5457,"A gentleman, who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin, was seated at the same table, and was breakfasting. He opened the conversation about rain and fine weather; the travelers replied. He drank to their good health, and the travelers returned his politeness. But at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready, and they were arising from table, the stranger proposed to Porthos to drink the health of the cardinal. Porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of the king. The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his Eminence. Porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword. “You have committed a piece of folly,” said Athos, “but it can’t be helped; there is no drawing back. Kill the fellow, and rejoin us as soon as you can”. All three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while Porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools.",test,1,2,0,gentleman arrived route seated table breakfasting opened conversation rain fine weather travelers replied drank good health travelers returned politeness moment came announce horses ready arising table stranger proposed drink health cardinal replied asked better stranger turn would drink health king stranger cried acknowledged king called drunk stranger drew sword committed piece folly said helped drawing back fellow rejoin us soon three remounted horses set good pace promising adversary perforate thrusts known fencing schools
5458,"“There goes one! ” cried Athos, at the end of five hundred paces. “But why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us? ” asked Aramis. “Because, as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took him for the chief,” said D’Artagnan. “I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom,” murmured Athos; and the travelers continued their route. At Beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for Porthos. At the end of two hours, as Porthos did not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey. At a league from Beauvais, where the road was confined between two high banks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud. Aramis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar, apostrophized them rather sharply.",test,1,2,0,goes one cried end five hundred paces man attack rather one us asked talking louder rest us took chief said always said cadet well wisdom murmured travelers continued route stopped two hours well breathe horses little wait end two hours come news resumed journey league road confined two high banks fell eight ten men taking advantage road unpaved spot appeared employed digging holes filling ruts mud liking soil boots artificial mortar apostrophized rather sharply
5459,"Athos wished to restrain him, but it was too late. The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos, who urged on his horse against one of them. Then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each took a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons. Aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder, and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins. Therefore Mousqueton alone fell from his horse, not because he was severely wounded, but not being able to see the wound, he judged it to be more serious than it really was. “It was an ambuscade! ” shouted D’Artagnan. “Don’t waste a charge! Forward! ”  Aramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried him on with the others.",test,1,2,0,wished restrain late laborers began jeer travelers insolence disturbed equanimity even cool urged horse one men retreated far ditch took concealed musket result seven travelers outnumbered weapons received ball passed shoulder another ball lodged fleshy part prolongs lower portion loins alone fell horse severely wounded able see wound judged serious really ambuscade shouted waste charge wounded seized mane horse carried others
5460,"Mousqueton’s horse rejoined them, and galloped by the side of his companions. “That will serve us for a relay,” said Athos. “I would rather have had a hat,” said D’Artagnan. “Mine was carried away by a ball. By my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was not in it”. “They’ll kill poor Porthos when he comes up,” said Aramis. “If Porthos were on his legs, he would have rejoined us by this time,” said Athos. “My opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated”. They continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service. The travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption; but at Crèvecœur, Aramis declared he could proceed no farther.",test,1,2,0,horse rejoined galloped side companions serve us relay said would rather hat said carried away ball faith fortunate letter kill poor comes said legs would rejoined us time said opinion ground drunken man intoxicated continued best speed two hours although horses fatigued feared would soon refuse service travelers chosen crossroads hope might meet less interruption declared could proceed farther
5461,"In fact, it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far. He grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support him on his horse. They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left Bazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Amiens. “_Morbleu_,” said Athos, as soon as they were again in motion, “reduced to two masters and Grimaud and Planchet! _Morbleu! _ I won’t be their dupe, I will answer for it. I will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and Calais. I swear by—”  “Don’t waste time in swearing,” said D’Artagnan; “let us gallop, if our horses will consent”. And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses’ flanks, who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies.

5462,"The host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth. He received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other. He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the hôtel. D’Artagnan and Athos refused them. The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies; but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground. The host insisted; but the travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished. They had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within, when someone knocked at the yard shutter; they demanded who was there, and recognizing the voices of their lackeys, opened the shutter. It was indeed Planchet and Grimaud. “Grimaud can take care of the horses,” said Planchet. “If you are willing, gentlemen, I will sleep across your doorway, and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you”.",test,1,2,0,host appearance honest man earth received travelers candlestick one hand cotton nightcap wished lodge two travelers charming chamber unfortunately charming chambers opposite extremities hôtel refused host replied worthy travelers declared would sleep common chamber mattress might thrown upon ground host insisted travelers firm obliged wished prepared beds barricaded door within someone knocked yard shutter demanded recognizing voices lackeys opened shutter indeed take care horses said willing gentlemen sleep across doorway certain nobody reach
5463,"“And on what will you sleep? ” said D’Artagnan. “Here is my bed,” replied Planchet, producing a bundle of straw. “Come, then,” said D’Artagnan, “you are right. Mine host’s face does not please me at all; it is too gracious”. “Nor me either,” said Athos. Planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway, while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable, undertaking that by five o’clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready. The night was quiet enough. Toward two o’clock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door; but as Planchet awoke in an instant and cried, “Who goes there? ” somebody replied that he was mistaken, and went away.",test,1,1,0,sleep said bed replied producing bundle straw said right hosts face please gracious either said mounted window installed across doorway went shut stable undertaking five clock morning four horses ready night quiet enough two clock morning somebody endeavored open door awoke instant cried goes somebody replied mistaken went away
5464,"At four o’clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables. Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys, and the stable boys had beaten him. When they opened the window, they saw the poor lad lying senseless, with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork. Planchet went down into the yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but the horses were all used up. Mousqueton’s horse which had traveled for five or six hours without a rider the day before, might have been able to pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary surgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the host’s horses, had bled Mousqueton’s. This began to be annoying. All these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance; but they might be the fruits of a plot. Athos and D’Artagnan went out, while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were not three horses for sale in the neighborhood. At the door stood two horses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped. These would just have suited them.",test,1,2,0,four clock morning heard terrible riot stables tried waken stable boys stable boys beaten opened window saw poor lad lying senseless head split blow pitchfork went yard wished saddle horses horses used horse traveled five six hours without rider day might able pursue journey inconceivable error veterinary surgeon sent appeared bleed one hosts horses bled began annoying successive accidents perhaps result chance might fruits plot went sent inquire three horses sale neighborhood door stood two horses fresh strong fully equipped would suited
5465,"He asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the host. Athos went down to pay the reckoning, while D’Artagnan and Planchet stood at the street door. The host was in a lower and back room, to which Athos was requested to go. Athos entered without the least mistrust, and took out two pistoles to pay the bill. The host was alone, seated before his desk, one of the drawers of which was partly open. He took the money which Athos offered to him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands, suddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers. “You blackguard! ” cried Athos, going toward him, “I’ll cut your ears off! ”  At the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side doors, and rushed upon Athos. “I am taken!",test,1,1,0,asked masters informed passed night inn settling bill host went pay reckoning stood street door host lower back room requested go entered without least mistrust took two pistoles pay bill host alone seated desk one drawers partly open took money offered turning turning hands suddenly cried bad would companions arrested forgers blackguard cried going toward cut ears instant four men armed teeth entered side doors rushed upon taken

D’Artagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried their spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop. “Do you know what has become of Athos? ” asked D’Artagnan of Planchet, as they galloped on. “Ah, monsieur,” said Planchet, “I saw one fall at each of his two shots, and he appeared to me, through the glass door, to be fighting with his sword with the others”. “Brave Athos! ” murmured D’Artagnan, “and to think that we are compelled to leave him; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence.",test,1,1,0,shouted power lungs spur fired two pistols require twice bidding unfastened two horses waiting door leaped upon buried spurs sides set full gallop know become asked galloped monsieur said saw one fall two shots appeared glass door fighting sword others murmured think compelled leave maybe fate awaits us two paces hence
5467,"Forward, Planchet, forward! You are a brave fellow”. “As I told you, monsieur,” replied Planchet, “Picards are found out by being used. Besides, I am here in my own country, and that excites me”. And both, with free use of the spur, arrived at St. Omer without drawing bit. At St. Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident, and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street, after they departed again. At a hundred paces from the gates of Calais, D’Artagnan’s horse gave out, and could not by any means be made to get up again, the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose. There still remained Planchet’s horse; but he stopped short, and could not be made to move a step. Fortunately, as we have said, they were within a hundred paces of the city; they left their two nags upon the high road, and ran toward the quay.

5468,"They made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared to be in great haste. His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to England. “Nothing would be more easy,” said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail, “but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal”. “I have that permission,” said the gentleman, drawing the paper from his pocket; “here it is”. “Have it examined by the governor of the port,” said the shipmaster, “and give me the preference”. “Where shall I find the governor? ”  “At his country house”. “And that is situated? ”  “At a quarter of a league from the city.

Once outside the city, D’Artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood. “Monsieur, you appear to be in great haste? ”  “No one can be more so, monsieur”. “I am sorry for that,” said D’Artagnan; “for as I am in great haste likewise, I wish to beg you to render me a service”. “What? ”  “To let me sail first”. “That’s impossible,” said the gentleman; “I have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours, and by tomorrow at midday I must be in London”.",test,1,1,1,well said gentleman lackey took road governors country house followed gentleman distance five hundred paces outside city overtook gentleman entering little wood appear great haste one monsieur sorry said great haste likewise wish beg render service let sail first impossible said gentleman traveled sixty leagues forty hours tomorrow midday must

Planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon Lubin; and being strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and placed his knee upon his breast. “Go on with your affair, monsieur,” cried Planchet; “I have finished mine”. Seeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon D’Artagnan; but he had too strong an adversary. In three seconds D’Artagnan had wounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, “One for Athos, one for Porthos; and one for Aramis! ”  At the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. D’Artagnan believed him to be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for it, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point into D’Artagnan’s breast, crying, “One for you! ”  “And one for me—the best for last! ” cried D’Artagnan, furious, nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.

5473,"D’Artagnan searched his pockets, and took from one of them the order for the passage. It was in the name of Comte de Wardes. Then, casting a glance on the handsome young man, who was scarcely twenty-five years of age, and whom he was leaving in his gore, deprived of sense and perhaps dead, he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist. But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin, who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might. Planchet grasped him by the throat, and pressed as hard as he could. “Monsieur,” said he, “as long as I hold him in this manner, he can’t cry, I’ll be bound; but as soon as I let go he will howl again. I know him for a Norman, and Normans are obstinate”. In fact, tightly held as he was, Lubin endeavored still to cry out. “Stay! ” said D’Artagnan; and taking out his handkerchief, he gagged him.",test,1,2,0,searched pockets took one order passage name de casting glance handsome young man scarcely twentyfive years age leaving gore deprived sense perhaps dead gave sigh unaccountable destiny leads men destroy interests people strangers often even know exist soon aroused reflections uttered loud cries screamed help might grasped throat pressed hard could said long hold manner cry bound soon let go howl know obstinate fact tightly held endeavored still cry said taking handkerchief gagged
5474,"“Now,” said Planchet, “let us bind him to a tree”. This being properly done, they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his servant; and as night was approaching, and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood, it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next day. “And now,” said D’Artagnan, “to the Governor’s”. “But you are wounded, it seems,” said Planchet. “Oh, that’s nothing! Let us attend to what is more pressing first, and then we will attend to my wound; besides, it does not seem very dangerous”. And they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary. The Comte de Wardes was announced, and D’Artagnan was introduced. “You have an order signed by the cardinal? ” said the governor.",test,1,1,0,said us bind tree properly done drew de close servant night approaching wounded man bound man little distance within wood evident likely remain till next day said wounded seems said nothing us attend pressing first attend wound besides seem dangerous set forward fast could toward country house worthy functionary de announced introduced order signed cardinal said governor
5475,"“Yes, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan; “here it is”. “Ah, ah! It is quite regular and explicit,” said the governor. “Most likely,” said D’Artagnan; “I am one of his most faithful servants”. “It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to England? ”  “Yes; a certain D’Artagnan, a Béarnese gentleman who left Paris in company with three of his friends, with the intention of going to London”. “Do you know him personally? ” asked the governor. “Whom? ”  “This D’Artagnan”.",test,1,4,1,monsieur replied ah quite regular explicit said governor likely said one faithful servants appears anxious prevent someone crossing certain gentleman left company three friends intention going know personally asked governor

And D’Artagnan gave, feature for feature, a description of the Comte de Wardes. “Is he accompanied? ”  “Yes; by a lackey named Lubin”. “We will keep a sharp lookout for them; and if we lay hands on them his Eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good escort”. “And by doing so, Monsieur the Governor,” said D’Artagnan, “you will deserve well of the cardinal”. “Shall you see him on your return, Monsieur Count? ”  “Without a doubt”.",test,1,1,1,well easy gave feature feature description de accompanied lackey named keep sharp lookout lay hands may assured reconducted good escort said deserve well cardinal see return doubt

D’Artagnan lost no time in useless compliments. He thanked the governor, bowed, and departed. Once outside, he and Planchet set off as fast as they could; and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate. The vessel was quite ready to sail, and the captain was waiting on the wharf. “Well? ” said he, on perceiving D’Artagnan. “Here is my pass countersigned,” said the latter.",test,1,1,0,beg humble servant fail assurance governor countersigned passport delivered lost time useless compliments thanked governor bowed departed outside set fast could making long detour avoided wood reentered city another gate vessel quite ready sail captain waiting wharf said perceiving pass countersigned said latter

He leaped with Planchet into the boat, and five minutes after they were on board. It was time; for they had scarcely sailed half a league, when D’Artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation. It was the cannon which announced the closing of the port. He had now leisure to look to his wound. Fortunately, as D’Artagnan had thought, it was not dangerous.

He threw himself upon it, and fell asleep. On the morrow, at break of day, they were still three or four leagues from the coast of England. The breeze had been so light all night, they had made but little progress. At ten o’clock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of Dover, and at half past ten D’Artagnan placed his foot on English land, crying, “Here I am at last! ”  But that was not all; they must get to London.

D’Artagnan did not know London; he did not know a word of English; but he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper, and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke’s hôtel. The duke was at Windsor hunting with the king. D’Artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke, who, having accompanied him in all his voyages, spoke French perfectly well; he told him that he came from Paris on an affair of life and death, and that he must speak with his master instantly. The confidence with which D’Artagnan spoke convinced Patrick, which was the name of this minister of the minister. He ordered two horses to be saddled, and himself went as guide to the young Guardsman. As for Planchet, he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush; the poor lad’s strength was almost exhausted. D’Artagnan seemed iron. On their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away. In twenty minutes they were on the spot named.",test,1,2,0,hours capital know know word wrote name piece paper everyone pointed way dukes hôtel duke hunting king inquired confidential valet duke accompanied voyages spoke perfectly well told came affair life death must speak master instantly confidence spoke convinced name minister minister ordered two horses saddled went guide young lifted horse stiff rush poor lads strength almost exhausted seemed iron arrival castle learned king hawking marshes two three leagues away twenty minutes spot named
5481,"Patrick soon caught the sound of his master’s voice calling his falcon. “Whom must I announce to my Lord Duke? ” asked Patrick. “The young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont Neuf, opposite the Samaritaine”. “A singular introduction! ”  “You will find that it is as good as another”. Patrick galloped off, reached the duke, and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him. Buckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that something was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be informed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and recognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into a gallop, and rode straight up to D’Artagnan. Patrick discreetly kept in the background. “No misfortune has happened to the queen?",test,1,1,0,soon caught sound masters voice calling falcon must announce asked young man one evening sought quarrel opposite singular introduction find good another galloped reached duke announced terms directed messenger awaited remembered circumstance suspecting something going necessary informed took time inquire messenger recognizing afar uniform put horse gallop rode straight discreetly kept background misfortune happened queen
5482,"” cried Buckingham, the instant he came up, throwing all his fear and love into the question. “I believe not; nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from which your Grace alone can extricate her”. “I! ” cried Buckingham. “What is it? I should be too happy to be of any service to her. Speak, speak! ”  “Take this letter,” said D’Artagnan. “This letter!

Come, monsieur, come! ” and both set off towards the capital at full gallop. Chapter XXI. THE COUNTESS DE WINTER   As they rode along, the duke endeavored to draw from D’Artagnan, not all that had happened, but what D’Artagnan himself knew. By adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances, he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which, for the rest, the queen’s letter, short but explicit, gave him the clue. But that which astonished him most was that the cardinal, so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in England, had not succeeded in arresting him on the road. It was then, upon the manifestation of this astonishment, that D’Artagnan related to him the precaution taken, and how, thanks to the devotion of his three friends, whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road, he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust, which had pierced the queen’s letter and for which he had repaid M. de Wardes with such terrible coin. While he was listening to this recital, delivered with the greatest simplicity, the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment, as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence, courage, and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years.",test,1,3,0,cried duke remain rather join king wherever may tell humbly beg excuse affair greatest importance recalls monsieur come set towards capital full gallop rode along duke endeavored draw happened knew adding heard mouth young man remembrances enabled form pretty exact idea position seriousness rest queens letter short explicit gave clue astonished cardinal deeply interested preventing young man setting foot succeeded arresting road upon manifestation astonishment related precaution taken thanks devotion three friends left scattered bleeding road succeeded coming single sword thrust pierced queens letter repaid de terrible coin listening recital delivered greatest simplicity duke looked time time young man astonishment could comprehend much prudence courage devotedness could allied countenance indicated twenty years
5485,"The horses went like the wind, and in a few minutes they were at the gates of London. D’Artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace, but it was not so. He kept on his way at the same rate, heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road. In fact, in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened; but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked down. D’Artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses. On entering the court of his hôtel, Buckingham sprang from his horse, and without thinking what became of the animal, threw the bridle on his neck, and sprang toward the vestibule. D’Artagnan did the same, with a little more concern, however, for the noble creatures, whose merits he fully appreciated; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables, and busy themselves with the steeds. The duke walked so fast that D’Artagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him. He passed through several apartments, of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea, and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness. In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal.",test,1,2,0,horses went like wind minutes gates imagined arriving town duke would slacken pace kept way rate heedless upsetting met road fact crossing city two three accidents kind happened even turn head see became knocked followed amid cries strongly resembled curses entering court hôtel sprang horse without thinking became animal threw bridle neck sprang toward vestibule little concern however noble creatures whose merits fully appreciated satisfaction seeing three four grooms run kitchens stables busy steeds duke walked fast trouble keeping passed several apartments elegance even greatest nobles even idea arrived length bedchamber miracle taste richness alcove chamber door concealed tapestry duke opened little gold key wore suspended neck chain metal
5486,"With discretion D’Artagnan remained behind; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed the threshold, he turned round, and seeing the hesitation of the young man, “Come in! ” cried he, “and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her Majesty’s presence, tell her what you have seen”. Encouraged by this invitation, D’Artagnan followed the duke, who closed the door after them. The two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold, and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles. Over a species of altar, and beneath a canopy of blue velvet, surmounted by white and red plumes, was a full-length portrait of Anne of Austria, so perfect in its resemblance that D’Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it. One might believe the queen was about to speak. On the altar, and beneath the portrait, was the casket containing the diamond studs. The duke approached the altar, knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix, and opened the casket. “There,” said he, drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds, “there are the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with me. The queen gave them to me, the queen requires them again.",test,1,2,0,discretion remained behind moment crossed threshold turned round seeing hesitation young man cried good fortune admitted presence tell seen invitation followed duke closed door two found small chapel covered tapestry silk worked gold brilliantly lighted vast number candles species altar beneath canopy blue velvet surmounted white red plumes fulllength portrait perfect resemblance uttered cry surprise beholding might believe queen speak altar beneath portrait casket containing diamond studs duke approached altar knelt priest might done crucifix opened casket said drawing casket large bow blue ribbon sparkling diamonds precious studs taken oath buried queen gave queen requires
5487,"Her will be done, like that of God, in all things”. Then, he began to kiss, one after the other, those dear studs with which he was about to part. All at once he uttered a terrible cry. “What is the matter? ” exclaimed D’Artagnan, anxiously; “what has happened to you, my Lord? ”  “All is lost! ” cried Buckingham, becoming as pale as a corpse; “two of the studs are wanting, there are only ten”. “Can you have lost them, my Lord, or do you think they have been stolen? ”  “They have been stolen,” replied the duke, “and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow.

5488,"The ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors”. “If my Lord suspects they have been stolen, perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands”. “Wait, wait! ” said the duke. “The only time I have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at Windsor. The Comtesse de Winter, with whom I had quarreled, became reconciled to me at that ball. That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman. I have never seen her from that day.

5490,"” His confidential valet appeared. “My jeweler and my secretary”. The valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without reply. But although the jeweler had been mentioned first, it was the secretary who first made his appearance. This was simply because he lived in the hôtel. He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber, writing orders with his own hand. “Mr. Jackson,” said he, “go instantly to the Lord Chancellor, and tell him that I charge him with the execution of these orders. I wish them to be promulgated immediately”. “But, my Lord, if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure, what shall I reply? ”  “That such is my pleasure, and that I answer for my will to no man”.",test,1,1,0,confidential valet appeared jeweler secretary valet went mute promptitude showed accustomed obey blindly without reply although jeweler mentioned first secretary first made appearance simply lived hôtel found seated table bedchamber writing orders hand said instantly tell charge execution orders wish promulgated immediately interrogates upon motives may led adopt extraordinary measure shall reply pleasure answer man
5491,"“Will that be the answer,” replied the secretary, smiling, “which he must transmit to his Majesty if, by chance, his Majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great Britain? ”  “You are right, Mr. Jackson,” replied Buckingham. “He will say, in that case, to the king that I am determined on war, and that this measure is my first act of hostility against France”. The secretary bowed and retired. “We are safe on that side,” said Buckingham, turning toward D’Artagnan. “If the studs are not yet gone to Paris, they will not arrive till after you”. “How so? ”  “I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his Majesty’s ports, and without particular permission, not one dare lift an anchor”. D’Artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues. Buckingham saw by the expression of the young man’s face what was passing in his mind, and he smiled.",test,1,2,0,answer replied secretary smiling must transmit chance curiosity know vessel leave ports right replied say case king determined war measure first act hostility secretary bowed retired safe side said turning toward studs yet gone arrive till placed embargo vessels present ports without particular permission one dare lift anchor looked stupefaction man thus employed unlimited power clothed confidence king prosecution intrigues saw expression young mans face passing mind smiled
5492,"“Yes,” said he, “yes, Anne of Austria is my true queen. Upon a word from her, I would betray my country, I would betray my king, I would betray my God. She asked me not to send the Protestants of La Rochelle the assistance I promised them; I have not done so. I broke my word, it is true; but what signifies that? I obeyed my love; and have I not been richly paid for that obedience? It was to that obedience I owe her portrait”. D’Artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended. He was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered. He was an Irishman—one of the most skillful of his craft, and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of Buckingham. “Mr. O’Reilly,” said the duke, leading him into the chapel, “look at these diamond studs, and tell me what they are worth apiece”.",test,1,2,0,said true queen word would betray country would betray king would betray asked send assistance promised done broke word true signifies obeyed love richly paid obedience obedience owe portrait amazed note fragile unknown threads destinies nations lives men suspended lost reflections goldsmith entered skillful craft confessed gained hundred thousand livres year said duke leading chapel diamond studs tell worth apiece
5493,"The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set, calculated, one with another, what the diamonds were worth, and without hesitation said, “Fifteen hundred pistoles each, my Lord”. “How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them? You see there are two wanting”. “Eight days, my Lord”. “I will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by the day after tomorrow”. “My Lord, they shall be yours”. “You are a jewel of a man, Mr. O’Reilly; but that is not all. These studs cannot be trusted to anybody; it must be done in the palace”. “Impossible, my Lord!

Name to me such of your workmen as you need, and point out the tools they must bring”. The goldsmith knew the duke. He knew all objection would be useless, and instantly determined how to act. “May I be permitted to inform my wife? ” said he. “Oh, you may even see her if you like, my dear Mr. O’Reilly. Your captivity shall be mild, be assured; and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification, here is, in addition to the price of the studs, an order for a thousand pistoles, to make you forget the annoyance I cause you”. D’Artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister, who thus open-handed, sported with men and millions.",test,1,1,1,dear prisoner wish ever leave palace make best workmen need point tools must bring goldsmith knew duke knew objection would useless instantly determined act permitted inform wife said may even see like dear captivity shall mild assured every inconvenience deserves indemnification addition price studs order thousand pistoles make forget annoyance cause could get surprise created minister thus openhanded sported men millions
5495,"As to the goldsmith, he wrote to his wife, sending her the order for the thousand pistoles, and charging her to send him, in exchange, his most skillful apprentice, an assortment of diamonds, of which he gave the names and the weight, and the necessary tools. Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him, and which, at the end of half an hour, was transformed into a workshop. Then he placed a sentinel at each door, with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his _valet de chambre_, Patrick. We need not add that the goldsmith, O’Reilly, and his assistant, were prohibited from going out under any pretext. This point, settled, the duke turned to D’Artagnan. “Now, my young friend,” said he, “England is all our own. What do you wish for? What do you desire? ”  “A bed, my Lord,” replied D’Artagnan. “At present, I confess, that is the thing I stand most in need of”.",test,1,1,0,goldsmith wrote wife sending order thousand pistoles charging send exchange skillful apprentice assortment diamonds gave names weight necessary tools conducted goldsmith chamber destined end half hour transformed workshop placed sentinel door order admit nobody upon pretense de chambre need add goldsmith assistant prohibited going pretext point settled duke turned young friend said wish desire bed replied present confess thing stand need
5496,"Buckingham gave D’Artagnan a chamber adjoining his own. He wished to have the young man at hand—not that he at all mistrusted him, but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen. In one hour after, the ordinance was published in London that no vessel bound for France should leave port, not even the packet boat with letters. In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms. On the day after the morrow, by eleven o’clock, the two diamond studs were finished, and they were so completely imitated, so perfectly alike, that Buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones, and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was. He immediately called D’Artagnan. “Here,” said he to him, “are the diamond studs that you came to bring; and be my witness that I have done all that human power could do”. “Be satisfied, my Lord, I will tell all that I have seen. But does your Grace mean to give me the studs without the casket? ”  “The casket would encumber you.",test,1,2,0,gave chamber adjoining wished young man hand—not mistrusted sake someone could constantly talk queen one hour ordinance published vessel bound leave port even packet boat letters eyes everybody declaration war two kingdoms day morrow eleven clock two diamond studs finished completely imitated perfectly alike could tell new ones old ones experts matters would deceived immediately called said diamond studs came bring witness done human power could satisfied tell seen mean give studs without casket casket would encumber
5497,"Besides, the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me. You will say that I keep it”. “I will perform your commission, word for word, my Lord”. “And now,” resumed Buckingham, looking earnestly at the young man, “how shall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you? ”  D’Artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes. He saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with English gold was strangely repugnant to him. “Let us understand each other, my Lord,” replied D’Artagnan, “and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake. I am in the service of the King and Queen of France, and form part of the company of Monsieur Dessessart, who, as well as his brother-in-law, Monsieur de Tréville, is particularly attached to their Majesties. What I have done, then, has been for the queen, and not at all for your Grace.

5498,"“Yes,” said the duke, smiling, “and I even believe that I know that other person; it is—”  “My Lord, I have not named her! ” interrupted the young man, warmly. “That is true,” said the duke; “and it is to this person I am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude”. “You have said, my Lord; for truly, at this moment when there is question of war, I confess to you that I see nothing in your Grace but an Englishman, and consequently an enemy whom I should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at Windsor or the corridors of the Louvre—all which, however, will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life, if there be need of it, to accomplish it; but I repeat it to your Grace, without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what I did for you in the first”. “We say, ‘Proud as a Scotsman,’” murmured the Duke of Buckingham. “And we say, ‘Proud as a Gascon,’” replied D’Artagnan. “The Gascons are the Scots of France”. D’Artagnan bowed to the duke, and was retiring. “Well, are you going away in that manner?

When you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern, without a name and without a sign—a mere fisherman’s hut.

Perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle; but in the meantime we shall part good friends, I hope”. “Yes, my Lord; but with the hope of soon becoming enemies”. “Be satisfied; I promise you that”. “I depend upon your word, my Lord”. D’Artagnan bowed to the duke, and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside. Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that had been named to him, delivered his letter to the captain, who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail.

5502,"Passing alongside one of them, D’Artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of Meung—the same whom the unknown gentleman had called Milady, and whom D’Artagnan had thought so handsome; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind, his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her. The next day about nine o’clock in the morning, he landed at St. Valery. D’Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn, and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it. War between England and France was talked of as near and certain, and the jolly sailors were having a carousal. D’Artagnan made his way through the crowd, advanced toward the host, and pronounced the word “Forward! ” The host instantly made him a sign to follow, went out with him by a door which opened into a yard, led him to the stable, where a saddled horse awaited him, and asked him if he stood in need of anything else. “I want to know the route I am to follow,” said D’Artagnan. “Go from hence to Blangy, and from Blangy to Neufchâtel. At Neufchâtel, go to the tavern of the Golden Harrow, give the password to the landlord, and you will find, as you have here, a horse ready saddled”. “Have I anything to pay?",test,1,2,0,alongside one fancied perceived board woman unknown gentleman called thought handsome thanks current stream fair wind vessel passed quickly little glimpse next day nine clock morning landed went instantly search inn easily discovered riotous noise resounded talked near certain jolly sailors carousal made way crowd advanced toward host pronounced word host instantly made sign follow went door opened yard led stable saddled horse awaited asked stood need anything else want know route follow said hence go tavern give password landlord find horse ready saddled anything pay

Four hours later he was in Neufchâtel. He strictly followed the instructions he had received. At Neufchâtel, as at St. Valery, he found a horse quite ready and awaiting him. He was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill, but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols. “Your address at Paris?",test,1,1,0,demanded paid replied host liberally may guide cried young man set full gallop hours later strictly followed instructions received found horse quite ready awaiting remove pistols saddle quit one fill found holsters furnished similar pistols address

You must stop at the little village of Eccuis, in which there is but one tavern—the Shield of France. Don’t condemn it from appearances; you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this”. “The same password? ”  “Exactly”. “Adieu, master!",test,1,4,0,company replied questioner route must take demanded turn leave city right must stop little village one tavern—the condemn appearances find horse stables quite good password master

He found as provident a host and a fresh horse. He left his address as he had done before, and set off again at the same pace for Pontoise. At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time, and at nine o’clock galloped into the yard of Tréville’s hôtel. He had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours. M. de Tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning; only, when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual, he informed him that the company of Dessessart was on duty at the Louvre, and that he might repair at once to his post.

5506,"THE BALLET OF LA MERLAISON   On the morrow, nothing was talked of in Paris but the ball which the aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen, and in which their Majesties were to dance the famous La Merlaison—the favorite ballet of the king. Eight days had been occupied in preparations at the Hôtel de Ville for this important evening. The city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed; the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred _flambeaux_ of white wax, a piece of luxury unheard of at that period; and twenty violins were ordered, and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate, upon condition, said the report, that they should be played all night. At ten o’clock in the morning the Sieur de la Coste, ensign in the king’s Guards, followed by two officers and several archers of that body, came to the city registrar, named Clement, and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel. These keys were given up to him instantly. Each of them had a ticket attached to it, by which it might be recognized; and from that moment the Sieur de la Coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues. At eleven o’clock came in his turn Duhallier, captain of the Guards, bringing with him fifty archers, who were distributed immediately through the Hôtel de Ville, at the doors assigned them. At three o’clock came two companies of the Guards, one French, the other Swiss. The company of French guards was composed of half of M. Duhallier’s men and half of M. Dessessart’s men.

5507,"As fast as they entered, they were placed in the grand saloon, on the platforms prepared for them. At nine o’clock Madame la Première Présidente arrived. As next to the queen, she was the most considerable personage of the fête, she was received by the city officials, and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy. At ten o’clock, the king’s collation, consisting of preserves and other delicacies, was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of St. Jean, in front of the silver buffet of the city, which was guarded by four archers. At midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard. It was the king, who was passing through the streets which led from the Louvre to the Hôtel de Ville, and which were all illuminated with colored lanterns. Immediately the aldermen, clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants, each holding a _flambeau_ in his hand, went to attend upon the king, whom they met on the steps, where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome—a compliment to which his Majesty replied with an apology for coming so late, laying the blame upon the cardinal, who had detained him till eleven o’clock, talking of affairs of state. His Majesty, in full dress, was accompanied by his royal Highness, M. le Comte de Soissons, by the Grand Prior, by the Duc de Longueville, by the Duc d’Eubœuf, by the Comte d’Harcourt, by the Comte de la Roche-Guyon, by M. de Liancourt, by M. de Baradas, by the Comte de Cramail, and by the Chevalier de Souveray.

5508,"In each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses. The same had been done for the queen and Madame the President. The nobles and ladies of their Majesties’ suites were to dress, two by two, in chambers prepared for the purpose. Before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived. Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were heard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as they had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to receive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and it was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary. At the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal appeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs. The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies.",test,1,2,0,closets placed masquerade dresses done queen nobles ladies suites dress two two chambers prepared purpose entering closet king desired informed moment cardinal arrived hour entrance king fresh acclamations heard announced arrival queen aldermen done preceded sergeants advanced receive illustrious guest queen entered great hall remarked like king looked dull even weary moment entered curtain small gallery time closed drawn pale face cardinal appeared dressed cavalier eyes fixed upon queen smile terrible joy passed lips queen wear diamond studs queen remained short time receive compliments city dignitaries reply salutations ladies
5509,"All at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was very pale. The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an altered voice said, “Why, madame, have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much gratification? ”  The queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a diabolical smile on his countenance. “Sire,” replied the queen, with a faltering voice, “because, in the midst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to them”. “And you were wrong, madame. If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong”. The voice of the king was tremulous with anger.",test,1,2,0,king appeared cardinal one doors hall cardinal speaking low voice king pale king made way crowd without mask ribbons doublet scarcely tied went straight queen altered voice said madame thought proper wear diamond studs know would give much gratification queen cast glance around saw cardinal behind diabolical smile countenance replied queen faltering voice midst crowd feared accident might happen wrong madame made present might adorn therewith tell wrong voice king tremulous anger
5510,"Everybody looked and listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed. “Sire,” said the queen, “I can send for them to the Louvre, where they are, and thus your Majesty’s wishes will be complied with”. “Do so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet will commence”. The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his apartment. There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them. The king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him.",test,1,1,0,looked listened astonishment comprehending nothing passed said queen send thus wishes complied madame within hour ballet commence queen bent token submission followed ladies conduct room part king returned apartment moment trouble confusion assembly remarked something passed king queen spoken low everybody respect withdrew several steps nobody heard anything violins began sound might nobody listened king came first room elegant hunting costume nobles dressed like
5511,"This was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom. The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small casket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs. “What does this mean? ” demanded he of the cardinal. “Nothing,” replied the latter; “only, if the queen has the studs, which I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here”. The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had not time to address any question to him—a cry of admiration burst from every mouth. If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom, the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in France. It is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably.",test,1,1,0,costume best became king dressed really appeared first gentleman kingdom cardinal drew near king placed hand small casket king opened found two diamond studs mean demanded cardinal replied latter queen studs much doubt count sire find ten ask stolen two studs king looked cardinal interrogate time address question him—a cry admiration burst every mouth king appeared first gentleman kingdom queen without doubt beautiful woman true habit huntress became admirably
5512,"She wore a beaver hat with blue feathers, a surtout of gray-pearl velvet, fastened with diamond clasps, and a petticoat of blue satin, embroidered with silver. On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs, on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the petticoat. The king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation; although, distant as they were from the queen, they could not count the studs. The queen had them. The only question was, had she ten or twelve? At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet. The king advanced toward Madame the President, with whom he was to dance, and his Highness Monsieur with the queen. They took their places, and the ballet began. The king danced facing the queen, and every time he passed by her, he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number. A cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal.",test,1,1,0,wore beaver hat blue feathers surtout graypearl velvet fastened diamond clasps petticoat blue satin embroidered silver left shoulder sparkled diamond studs bow color plumes petticoat king trembled joy cardinal vexation although distant queen could count studs queen question ten twelve moment violins sounded signal ballet king advanced toward dance queen took places ballet began king danced facing queen every time passed devoured eyes studs could ascertain number cold sweat covered brow cardinal
5513,"The ballet lasted an hour, and had sixteen _entrées_. The ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage, and everyone reconducted his lady to her place; but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady, to advance eagerly toward the queen. “I thank you, madame,” said he, “for the deference you have shown to my wishes, but I think you want two of the studs, and I bring them back to you”. With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given him. “How, sire? ” cried the young queen, affecting surprise, “you are giving me, then, two more: I shall have fourteen”. In fact the king counted them, and the twelve studs were all on her Majesty’s shoulder. The king called the cardinal. “What does this mean, Monsieur Cardinal? ” asked the king in a severe tone.",test,1,1,0,ballet lasted hour sixteen ballet ended amid applause whole assemblage everyone reconducted lady place king took advantage privilege leaving lady advance eagerly toward queen thank madame said deference shown wishes think want two studs bring back words held queen two studs cardinal given sire cried young queen affecting surprise giving two shall fourteen fact king counted twelve studs shoulder king called cardinal mean asked king severe tone
5514,"“This means, sire,” replied the cardinal, “that I was desirous of presenting her Majesty with these two studs, and that not daring to offer them myself, I adopted this means of inducing her to accept them”. “And I am the more grateful to your Eminence,” replied Anne of Austria, with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry, “from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his Majesty”. Then saluting the king and the cardinal, the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed, and where she was to take off her costume. The attention which we have been obliged to give, during the commencement of the chapter, to the illustrious personages we have introduced into it, has diverted us for an instant from him to whom Anne of Austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the cardinal; and who, confounded, unknown, lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors, looked on at this scene, comprehensible only to four persons—the king, the queen, his Eminence, and himself. The queen had just regained her chamber, and D’Artagnan was about to retire, when he felt his shoulder lightly touched. He turned and saw a young woman, who made him a sign to follow her. The face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask; but notwithstanding this precaution, which was in fact taken rather against others than against him, he at once recognized his usual guide, the light and intelligent Mme. Bonacieux. On the evening before, they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the Swiss guard, Germain, whither D’Artagnan had sent for her. The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words.",test,1,3,2,means sire replied cardinal desirous presenting two studs daring offer adopted means inducing accept grateful replied smile proved dupe ingenious gallantry certain two studs alone cost much others cost saluting king cardinal queen resumed way chamber dressed take costume attention obliged give commencement chapter illustrious personages introduced diverted us instant owed extraordinary triumph obtained cardinal confounded unknown lost crowd gathered one doors looked scene comprehensible four persons—the king queen queen regained chamber retire felt shoulder lightly touched turned saw young woman made sign follow face young woman covered black velvet mask notwithstanding precaution fact taken rather others recognized usual guide light intelligent evening scarcely seen moment apartment guard whither sent haste young woman convey queen excellent news happy return messenger prevented two lovers exchanging words
5515,"D’Artagnan therefore followed Mme. Bonacieux moved by a double sentiment—love and curiosity. All the way, and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted, D’Artagnan wished to stop the young woman, seize her and gaze upon her, were it only for a minute; but quick as a bird she glided between his hands, and when he wished to speak to her, her finger placed upon her mouth, with a little imperative gesture full of grace, reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey, and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint. At length, after winding about for a minute or two, Mme. Bonacieux opened the door of a closet, which was entirely dark, and led D’Artagnan into it. There she made a fresh sign of silence, and opened a second door concealed by tapestry. The opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light, and she disappeared. D’Artagnan remained for a moment motionless, asking himself where he could be; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber, together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture, the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined, and the word “Majesty” several times repeated, indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen’s apartment. The young man waited in comparative darkness and listened. The queen appeared cheerful and happy, which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care.",test,1,3,2,therefore followed moved double sentiment—love curiosity way proportion corridors became deserted wished stop young woman seize gaze upon minute quick bird glided hands wished speak finger placed upon mouth little imperative gesture full grace reminded command power must blindly obey forbade even make slightest complaint length winding minute two opened door closet entirely dark led made fresh sign silence opened second door concealed tapestry opening door disclosed brilliant light disappeared remained moment motionless asking could soon ray light penetrated chamber together warm perfumed air reached aperture conversation two three ladies language respectful refined word several times repeated indicated clearly closet attached queens apartment young man waited comparative darkness listened queen appeared cheerful happy seemed astonish persons surrounded accustomed see almost always sad full care
5516,"The queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fête, to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet; and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen, whether she smile or weep, everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of Paris. Although D’Artagnan did not at all know the queen, he soon distinguished her voice from the others, at first by a slightly foreign accent, and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words. He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door; and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the light. At length a hand and an arm, surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness, glided through the tapestry. D’Artagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense. He cast himself on his knees, seized the hand, and touched it respectfully with his lips. Then the hand was withdrawn, leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring. The door immediately closed, and D’Artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity. D’Artagnan placed the ring on his finger, and again waited; it was evident that all was not yet over. After the reward of his devotion, that of his love was to come.",test,1,2,0,queen attributed joyous feeling beauty fête pleasure experienced ballet permissible contradict queen whether smile weep everybody expatiated gallantry aldermen city know queen soon distinguished voice others first slightly foreign accent next tone domination naturally impressed upon royal words heard approach withdraw partially open door twice three times even saw shadow person intercept light length hand arm surpassingly beautiful form whiteness glided tapestry comprehended recompense cast knees seized hand touched respectfully lips hand withdrawn leaving object perceived ring door immediately closed found complete obscurity placed ring finger waited evident yet reward devotion love come
5517,"Besides, although the ballet was danced, the evening had scarcely begun. Supper was to be served at three, and the clock of St. Jean had struck three quarters past two. The sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber. The company was then heard departing; then the door of the closet in which D’Artagnan was, was opened, and Mme. Bonacieux entered. “You at last? ” cried D’Artagnan. “Silence! ” said the young woman, placing her hand upon his lips; “silence, and go the same way you came! ”  “But where and when shall I see you again?",test,1,4,0,although ballet danced evening scarcely begun served three clock struck three quarters past two sound voices diminished degrees adjoining chamber company heard departing door closet opened entered last cried said young woman placing hand upon lips go way came shall see
5518,"” cried D’Artagnan. “A note which you will find at home will tell you. Begone, begone! ”  At these words she opened the door of the corridor, and pushed D’Artagnan out of the room. D’Artagnan obeyed like a child, without the least resistance or objection, which proved that he was really in love. Chapter XXIII. THE RENDEZVOUS   D’Artagnan ran home immediately, and although it was three o’clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of Paris to traverse, he met with no misadventure. Everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity. He found the door of his passage open, sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey. Planchet*, whom he had sent home two hours before from the Hôtel de Ville, telling him to sit up for him, opened the door for him.",test,1,1,0,cried note find home tell begone words opened door corridor pushed room obeyed like child without least resistance objection proved really love ran home immediately although three clock morning worst quarters traverse met misadventure knows drunkards lovers protecting deity found door passage open sprang stairs knocked softly manner agreed upon lackey sent home two hours de telling sit opened door
5519,"* The reader may ask, “How came Planchet here? ” when he was left “stiff as a rush” in London. In the intervening time Buckingham perhaps sent him to Paris, as he did the horses. “Has anyone brought a letter for me? ” asked D’Artagnan, eagerly. “No one has _brought_ a letter, monsieur,” replied Planchet; “but one has come of itself”. “What do you mean, blockhead? ”  “I mean to say that when I came in, although I had the key of your apartment in my pocket, and that key had never quit me, I found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom”. “And where is that letter? ”  “I left it where I found it, monsieur.",test,1,1,0,reader may ask came left rush intervening time perhaps sent horses anyone brought letter asked eagerly one letter monsieur replied one come mean blockhead mean say came although key apartment pocket key never quit found letter green table cover bedroom letter left found monsieur
5520,"It is not natural for letters to enter people’s houses in this manner. If the window had been open or even ajar, I should think nothing of it; but, no—all was hermetically sealed. Beware, monsieur; there is certainly some magic underneath”. Meanwhile, the young man had darted in to his chamber, and opened the letter. It was from Mme. Bonacieux, and was expressed in these terms:  “There are many thanks to be offered to you, and to be transmitted to you. Be this evening about ten o’clock at St. Cloud, in front of the pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of M. d’Estrées. —C.B.”  While reading this letter, D’Artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers. It was the first billet he had received; it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him.

5521,"“Well, monsieur,” said Planchet, who had observed his master grow red and pale successively, “did I not guess truly? Is it not some bad affair? ”  “You are mistaken, Planchet,” replied D’Artagnan; “and as a proof, there is a crown to drink my health”. “I am much obliged to Monsieur for the crown he has given me, and I promise him to follow his instructions exactly; but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut-up houses—”  “Fall from heaven, my friend, fall from heaven”. “Then Monsieur is satisfied? ” asked Planchet. “My dear Planchet, I am the happiest of men! ”  “And I may profit by Monsieur’s happiness, and go to bed? ”  “Yes, go”. “May the blessings of heaven fall upon Monsieur!",test,1,1,1,monsieur said observed master grow red pale successively guess truly bad affair mistaken replied proof crown drink health much obliged crown given promise follow instructions exactly less true letters come way shutup houses— heaven friend fall heaven satisfied asked dear happiest men may profit happiness go bed go blessings heaven fall upon
5522,"But it is not the less true that that letter—”  And Planchet retired, shaking his head with an air of doubt, which the liberality of D’Artagnan had not entirely effaced. Left alone, D’Artagnan read and reread his billet. Then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress. At length he went to bed, fell asleep, and had golden dreams. At seven o’clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet, who at the second summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night. “Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, “I am going out for all day, perhaps. You are, therefore, your own master till seven o’clock in the evening; but at seven o’clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses”. “There! ” said Planchet. “We are going again, it appears, to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways”.",test,1,2,0,less true letter— retired shaking head air doubt liberality entirely effaced alone read reread billet kissed rekissed twenty times lines traced hand beautiful mistress length went bed fell asleep golden dreams seven clock morning arose called second summons opened door countenance yet quite freed anxiety preceding night said going day perhaps therefore master till seven clock evening seven clock must hold readiness two horses said going appears hides pierced sorts ways

5525,"D’Artagnan’s intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to stop, but to enter into conversation with him. Besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at St. Cloud, opposite D’Estrées’s pavilion? D’Artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume. The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man. M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that D’Artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased to designate, during his account, by the title of the “cardinal’s executioner,” and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of torture. D’Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had finished said, “And Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her off? —For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance”. “Ah! ” said Bonacieux, “they took good care not to tell me that; and my wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that’s sacred that she does not know.

About forty leagues only. We went to take Monsieur Athos to the waters of Forges, where my friends still remain”. “And you have returned, have you not? ” replied M.

Yes, I was expected, and very impatiently, I acknowledge”. A slight shade passed over the brow of Bonacieux, but so slight that D’Artagnan did not perceive it. “And we are going to be recompensed for our diligence? ” continued the mercer, with a trifling alteration in his voice—so trifling, indeed, that D’Artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which, an instant before, had darkened the countenance of the worthy man. “Ah, may you be a true prophet! ” said D’Artagnan, laughing. “No; what I say,” replied Bonacieux, “is only that I may know whether I am delaying you”. “Why that question, my dear host? ” asked D’Artagnan.",test,1,2,1,said young man laughing confess much readily dear see concealing anything expected impatiently acknowledge slight shade passed brow slight perceive going recompensed diligence continued mercer trifling alteration voice—so trifling indeed perceive momentary shade instant darkened countenance worthy man may true prophet said laughing say replied may know whether delaying question dear host asked

This time Bonacieux became so pale that D’Artagnan could not help perceiving it, and asked him what was the matter. “Nothing,” replied Bonacieux, “nothing. Since my misfortunes I have been subject to faintnesses, which seize me all at once, and I have just felt a cold shiver.

And perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as I do; perhaps this evening Madame Bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile”. “Madame Bonacieux is not at liberty this evening,” replied the husband, seriously; “she is detained at the Louvre this evening by her duties”. “So much the worse for you, my dear host, so much the worse!

5530,"But D’Artagnan was too far off to hear him; and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed, he certainly would not have remarked it. He took his way toward the hôtel of M. de Tréville; his visit of the day before, it is to be remembered, had been very short and very little explicative. He found Tréville in a joyful mood. He had thought the king and queen charming at the ball. It is true the cardinal had been particularly ill-tempered. He had retired at one o’clock under the pretense of being indisposed. As to their Majesties, they did not return to the Louvre till six o’clock in the morning. “Now,” said Tréville, lowering his voice, and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone, “now let us talk about yourself, my young friend; for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king, the triumph of the queen, and the humiliation of his Eminence. You must look out for yourself”. “What have I to fear,” replied D’Artagnan, “as long as I shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their Majesties?",test,1,2,0,far hear heard disposition mind enjoyed certainly would remarked took way toward hôtel de visit day remembered short little explicative found joyful mood thought king queen charming ball true cardinal particularly illtempered retired one clock pretense indisposed return till six clock morning said lowering voice looking every corner apartment see alone let us talk young friend evident happy return something joy king triumph queen humiliation must look fear replied long shall luck enjoy favor

Stop a minute—ah, this is it: ‘Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,’ which means, ‘Beware of the enemy who makes you presents”. “This diamond does not come from an enemy, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan, “it comes from the queen”. “From the queen!

At nine o’clock, then, be ready here at the hôtel, I will come and take you”. Planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project, heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse. As to D’Artagnan, being at bottom a prudent youth, instead of returning home, went and dined with the Gascon priest, who, at the time of the distress of the four friends, had given them a breakfast of chocolate.

5546,"The fourth horse had arrived. Planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol. D’Artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and departed quietly. It was quite dark, and no one saw them go out. Planchet took place behind his master, and kept at a distance of ten paces from him. D’Artagnan crossed the quays, went out by the gate of La Conférence and followed the road, much more beautiful then than it is now, which leads to St. Cloud. As long as he was in the city, Planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself; but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark, he drew softly nearer, so that when they entered the Bois de Boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master. In fact, we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness. D’Artagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said, “Well, Monsieur Planchet, what is the matter with us now? ”  “Don’t you think, monsieur, that woods are like churches?",test,1,2,0,fourth horse arrived armed musketoon pistol sword placed two pistols belt mounted departed quietly quite dark one saw go took place behind master kept distance ten paces crossed quays went gate followed road much beautiful leads long city kept respectful distance imposed upon soon road began lonely dark drew softly nearer entered de found riding quite naturally side side master fact must dissemble oscillation tall trees reflection moon dark underwood gave serious uneasiness could help perceiving something usual passing mind lackey said matter us think monsieur woods like churches

Yes, monsieur”. “Afraid of being heard! Why, there is nothing improper in our conversation, my dear Planchet, and no one could find fault with it”. “Ah, monsieur! ” replied Planchet, recurring to his besetting idea, “that Monsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows, and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips”. “What the devil makes you think of Bonacieux?",test,1,1,1,dare speak aloud one dare speak aloud afraid heard monsieur heard nothing improper conversation dear one could find fault monsieur replied recurring besetting idea something vicious eyebrows something unpleasant play lips devil makes think

Had we not better lower our heads? ”  “In truth,” murmured D’Artagnan, to whom M. de Tréville’s recommendation recurred, “this animal will end by making me afraid”. And he put his horse into a trot.

5550,"“Here’s half a pistole. Tomorrow morning”. D’Artagnan sprang from his horse, threw the bridle to Planchet, and departed at a quick pace, folding his cloak around him. “Good Lord, how cold I am! ” cried Planchet, as soon as he had lost sight of his master; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern, and knocked at the door. In the meantime D’Artagnan, who had plunged into a bypath, continued his route and reached St. Cloud; but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château, reached a sort of retired lane, and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named. It was situated in a very private spot. A high wall, at the angle of which was the pavilion, ran along one side of this lane, and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers-by. He gained the place appointed, and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence, he waited. Not the least noise was to be heard; it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the capital.",test,1,2,0,half pistole morning sprang horse threw bridle departed quick pace folding cloak around cold cried soon lost sight master haste warm went straight house set attributes suburban tavern knocked door meantime plunged bypath continued route reached instead following main street turned behind château reached sort retired lane found soon front pavilion named situated private spot high wall angle pavilion ran along one side lane little garden connected poor cottage protected hedge passersby gained place appointed signal given announce presence waited least noise heard might imagined hundred miles capital
5551,"D’Artagnan leaned against the hedge, after having cast a glance behind it. Beyond that hedge, that garden, and that cottage, a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where Paris slept—a vast void from which glittered a few luminous points, the funeral stars of that hell! But for D’Artagnan all aspects were clothed happily, all ideas wore a smile, all shades were diaphanous. The appointed hour was about to strike. In fact, at the end of a few minutes the belfry of St. Cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws. There was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night; but each of those strokes, which made up the expected hour, vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man. His eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall, of which all the windows were closed with shutters, except one on the first story. Through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park. There could be no doubt that behind this little window, which threw forth such friendly beams, the pretty Mme. Bonacieux expected him.",test,1,2,0,leaned hedge cast glance behind hedge garden cottage dark mist enveloped folds immensity slept—a vast void glittered luminous points funeral stars hell aspects clothed happily ideas wore smile shades diaphanous appointed hour strike fact end minutes belfry let fall slowly ten strokes sonorous jaws something melancholy brazen voice pouring lamentations middle night strokes made expected hour vibrated harmoniously heart young man eyes fixed upon little pavilion situated angle wall windows closed shutters except one first story window shone mild light silvered foliage two three linden trees formed group outside park could doubt behind little window threw forth friendly beams pretty expected
5552,"Wrapped in this sweet idea, D’Artagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience, his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings, attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment. The belfry of St. Cloud sounded half past ten. This time, without knowing why, D’Artagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins. Perhaps the cold began to affect him, and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression. Then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly, and that the appointment was for eleven o’clock. He drew near to the window, and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it, he drew it from his pocket and read it again; but he had not been mistaken, the appointment was for ten o’clock. He went and resumed his post, beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude. Eleven o’clock sounded. D’Artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to Mme. Bonacieux.",test,1,2,0,sweet idea waited half hour without least impatience eyes fixed upon charming little abode could perceive part ceiling gilded moldings attesting elegance rest apartment belfry sounded half past ten time without knowing felt cold shiver run veins cold began affect took perfectly physical sensation moral impression idea seized read incorrectly appointment eleven clock drew near window placing ray light fall upon letter held drew pocket read mistaken appointment ten clock went resumed post beginning rather uneasy silence solitude clock sounded began really fear something happened
5553,"He clapped his hands three times—the ordinary signal of lovers; but nobody replied to him, not even an echo. He then thought, with a touch of vexation, that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him. He approached the wall, and tried to climb it; but the wall had been recently pointed, and D’Artagnan could get no hold. At that moment he thought of the trees, upon whose leaves the light still shone; and as one of them drooped over the road, he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion. The tree was easy to climb. Besides, D’Artagnan was but twenty years old, and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits. In an instant he was among the branches, and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion. It was a strange thing, and one which made D’Artagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair, to find that this soft light, this calm lamp, enlightened a scene of fearful disorder. One of the windows was broken, the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung, split in two, on its hinges. A table, which had been covered with an elegant supper, was overturned.",test,1,2,0,clapped hands three times—the ordinary signal lovers nobody replied even echo thought touch vexation perhaps young woman fallen asleep waiting approached wall tried climb wall recently pointed could get hold moment thought trees upon whose leaves light still shone one drooped road thought branches might get glimpse interior pavilion tree easy climb twenty years old consequently yet forgotten schoolboy habits instant among branches keen eyes plunged transparent panes interior pavilion strange thing one made tremble sole foot roots hair find soft light calm lamp enlightened scene fearful disorder windows broken door chamber beaten hung split two hinges table covered elegant supper overturned
5554,"The decanters broken in pieces, and the fruits crushed, strewed the floor. Everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle. D’Artagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder, fragments of garments, and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains. He hastened to descend into the street, with a frightful beating at his heart; he wished to see if he could find other traces of violence. The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night. D’Artagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked—for nothing had led him to the examination—that the ground, trampled here and hoofmarked there, presented confused traces of men and horses. Besides, the wheels of a carriage, which appeared to have come from Paris, had made a deep impression in the soft earth, which did not extend beyond the pavilion, but turned again toward Paris. At length D’Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found near the wall a woman’s torn glove. This glove, wherever it had not touched the muddy ground, was of irreproachable odor. It was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand.",test,1,2,0,decanters broken pieces fruits crushed strewed floor apartment gave evidence violent desperate struggle even fancied could recognize amid strange disorder fragments garments bloody spots staining cloth curtains hastened descend street frightful beating heart wished see could find traces violence little soft light shone calmness night perceived thing remarked—for nothing led examination—that ground trampled hoofmarked presented confused traces men horses wheels carriage appeared come made deep impression soft earth extend beyond pavilion turned toward length pursuing researches found near wall womans torn glove glove wherever touched muddy ground irreproachable odor one perfumed gloves lovers like snatch pretty hand
5555,"As D’Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short. And yet he said, to reassure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with Mme. Bonacieux; that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion, and not in the pavilion; that she might have been detained in Paris by her duties, or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband. But all these reasons were combated, destroyed, overthrown, by that feeling of intimate pain which, on certain occasions, takes possession of our being, and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us. Then D’Artagnan became almost wild. He ran along the high road, took the path he had before taken, and reaching the ferry, interrogated the boatman. About seven o’clock in the evening, the boatman had taken over a young woman, wrapped in a black mantle, who appeared to be very anxious not to be recognized; but entirely on account of her precautions, the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty. There were then, as now, a crowd of young and pretty women who came to St. Cloud, and who had reasons for not being seen, and yet D’Artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was Mme. Bonacieux whom the boatman had noticed. D’Artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of Mme.",test,1,3,0,pursued investigations abundant icy sweat rolled large drops forehead heart oppressed horrible anguish respiration broken short yet said reassure pavilion perhaps nothing common young woman made appointment pavilion pavilion might detained duties perhaps jealousy husband reasons combated destroyed overthrown feeling intimate pain certain occasions takes possession cries us understood unmistakably great misfortune hanging us became almost wild ran along high road took path taken reaching ferry interrogated boatman seven clock evening boatman taken young woman wrapped black mantle appeared anxious recognized entirely account precautions boatman paid attention discovered young pretty crowd young pretty women came reasons seen yet instant doubt boatman noticed took advantage lamp burned cabin ferryman read billet
5556,"Bonacieux once again, and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken, that the appointment was at St. Cloud and not elsewhere, before the D’Estrées’s pavilion and not in another street. Everything conspired to prove to D’Artagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him, and that a great misfortune had happened. He again ran back to the château. It appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence, and that fresh information awaited him. The lane was still deserted, and the same calm soft light shone through the window. D’Artagnan then thought of that cottage, silent and obscure, which had no doubt seen all, and could tell its tale. The gate of the enclosure was shut; but he leaped over the hedge, and in spite of the barking of a chained-up dog, went up to the cabin. No one answered to his first knocking. A silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion; but as the cabin was his last resource, he knocked again. It soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within—a timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard.",test,1,2,0,satisfy mistaken appointment elsewhere pavilion another street conspired prove presentiments deceived great misfortune happened ran back château appeared something might happened pavilion absence fresh information awaited lane still deserted calm soft light shone window thought cottage silent obscure doubt seen could tell tale gate enclosure shut leaped hedge spite barking chainedup dog went cabin one answered first knocking silence death reigned cabin pavilion cabin last resource knocked soon appeared heard slight noise within—a timid noise seemed tremble lest heard
5557,"Then D’Artagnan ceased knocking, and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises, terror and cajolery, that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful. At length an old, worm-eaten shutter was opened, or rather pushed ajar, but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric, sword belt, and pistol pommels of D’Artagnan. Nevertheless, rapid as the movement had been, D’Artagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man. “In the name of heaven! ” cried he, “listen to me; I have been waiting for someone who has not come. I am dying with anxiety. Has anything particular happened in the neighborhood? Speak! ”  The window was again opened slowly, and the same face appeared, only it was now still more pale than before.

5558,"He told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion, and how, not seeing her come, he had climbed the linden tree, and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber. The old man listened attentively, making a sign only that it was all so; and then, when D’Artagnan had ended, he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good. “What do you mean? ” cried D’Artagnan. “In the name of heaven, explain yourself! ”  “Oh! Monsieur,” said the old man, “ask me nothing; for if I dared tell you what I have seen, certainly no good would befall me”. “You have, then, seen something? ” replied D’Artagnan. “In that case, in the name of heaven,” continued he, throwing him a pistole, “tell me what you have seen, and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart”.",test,1,1,0,told rendezvous young woman pavilion seeing come climbed linden tree light lamp seen disorder chamber old man listened attentively making sign ended shook head air announced nothing good mean cried name heaven explain said old man nothing dared tell seen certainly good would befall seen something replied case name heaven continued throwing pistole seen pledge word gentleman one words shall escape heart
5559,"The old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low voice: “It was scarcely nine o’clock when I heard a noise in the street, and was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door, I found that somebody was endeavoring to open it. As I am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed, I went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it. In the shadow was a carriage with two horses, and some saddlehorses. These horses evidently belonged to the three men, who were dressed as cavaliers. ‘Ah, my worthy gentlemen,’ cried I, ‘what do you want? ’ ‘You must have a ladder? ’ said he who appeared to be the leader of the party. ‘Yes, monsieur, the one with which I gather my fruit. ’ ‘Lend it to us, and go into your house again; there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you. Only remember this—if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear (for you will look and you will listen, I am quite sure, however we may threaten you), you are lost.",test,1,2,0,old man read much truth much grief face young man made sign listen repeated low voice scarcely nine clock heard noise street wondering could coming door found somebody endeavoring open poor afraid robbed went opened gate saw three men paces shadow carriage two horses saddlehorses horses evidently belonged three men dressed cavaliers worthy gentlemen cried want must ladder said appeared leader party monsieur one gather fruit us go house crown annoyance caused remember this—if speak word may see may hear look listen quite sure however may threaten lost
5560,"’ At these words he threw me a crown, which I picked up, and he took the ladder. After shutting the gate behind them, I pretended to return to the house, but I immediately went out a back door, and stealing along in the shade of the hedge, I gained yonder clump of elder, from which I could hear and see everything. The three men brought the carriage up quietly, and took out of it a little man, stout, short, elderly, and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color, who ascended the ladder very carefully, looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion, came down as quietly as he had gone up, and whispered, ‘It is she! ’ Immediately, he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion, opened it with a key he had in his hand, closed the door and disappeared, while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder. The little old man remained at the coach door; the coachman took care of his horses, the lackey held the saddlehorses. All at once great cries resounded in the pavilion, and a woman came to the window, and opened it, as if to throw herself out of it; but as soon as she perceived the other two men, she fell back and they went into the chamber. Then I saw no more; but I heard the noise of breaking furniture. The woman screamed, and cried for help; but her cries were soon stifled. Two of the men appeared, bearing the woman in their arms, and carried her to the carriage, into which the little old man got after her.

5561,"His two companions were already on horseback. He sprang into his saddle; the lackey took his place by the coachman; the carriage went off at a quick pace, escorted by the three horsemen, and all was over. From that moment I have neither seen nor heard anything”. D’Artagnan, entirely overcome by this terrible story, remained motionless and mute, while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart. “But, my good gentleman,” resumed the old man, upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done, “do not take on so; they did not kill her, and that’s a comfort”. “Can you guess,” said D’Artagnan, “who was the man who headed this infernal expedition? ”  “I don’t know him”. “But as you spoke to him you must have seen him”. “Oh, it’s a description you want? ”  “Exactly so”.",test,1,1,0,two companions already horseback sprang saddle lackey took place coachman carriage went quick pace escorted three horsemen moment neither seen heard anything entirely overcome terrible story remained motionless mute demons anger jealousy howling heart good gentleman resumed old man upon mute despair certainly produced greater effect cries tears would done take kill comfort guess said man headed infernal expedition know spoke must seen description want

And the other? ”  “Which? ”  “The short one”. “Oh, he was not a gentleman, I’ll answer for it; besides, he did not wear a sword, and the others treated him with small consideration”. “Some lackey,” murmured D’Artagnan. “Poor woman, poor woman, what have they done with you?",test,1,4,0,tall dark man black mustaches dark eyes air gentleman man cried forever demon apparently short one gentleman answer besides wear sword others treated small consideration lackey murmured woman poor woman done

With a heavy heart, D’Artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry. Sometimes he hoped it could not be Mme. Bonacieux, and that he should find her next day at the Louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and carried her off. His mind was torn by doubt, grief, and despair. “Oh, if I had my three friends here,” cried he, “I should have, at least, some hopes of finding her; but who knows what has become of them?",test,1,1,2,promised secret good monsieur said old man renew promise easy gentleman gentleman word given mine heavy heart bent way toward ferry hoped could find next day sometimes feared intrigue another jealous fit surprised carried mind torn doubt grief despair three friends cried least hopes finding knows become
5564,"”  It was past midnight; the next thing was to find Planchet. D’Artagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light, but could not find Planchet in any of them. At the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious. D’Artagnan had appointed six o’clock in the morning for his lackey, and wherever he might be, he was right. Besides, it came into the young man’s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed, he would, perhaps, have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair. At the sixth cabaret, then, as we said, D’Artagnan stopped, asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality, and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room, determined thus to wait till daylight; but this time again his hopes were disappointed, and although he listened with all his ears, he heard nothing, amid the oaths, coarse jokes, and abuse which passed between the laborers, servants, and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part, which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him. He was compelled, then, after having swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep, whether well or ill. D’Artagnan, be it remembered, was only twenty years old, and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon, even with the saddest hearts. Toward six o’clock D’Artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night. He was not long in making his toilet.",test,1,3,0,past midnight next thing find went successively cabarets light could find sixth began reflect search rather dubious appointed six clock morning lackey wherever might right came young mans mind remaining environs spot sad event passed would perhaps light thrown upon mysterious affair sixth cabaret said stopped asked bottle wine best quality placing darkest corner room determined thus wait till daylight time hopes disappointed although listened ears heard nothing amid oaths coarse jokes abuse passed laborers servants carters comprised honorable society formed part could put upon least track stolen compelled swallowed contents bottle pass time well evade suspicion fall easiest position corner sleep whether well ill remembered twenty years old age sleep imprescriptible rights imperiously insists upon even saddest hearts six clock awoke uncomfortable feeling generally accompanies break day bad night long making toilet
5565,"He examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep, and having found his diamond ring on his finger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose, paid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before. The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest Planchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret, before which D’Artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence. Chapter XXV. PORTHOS   Instead of returning directly home, D’Artagnan alighted at the door of M. de Tréville, and ran quickly up the stairs. This time he had decided to relate all that had passed. M. de Tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Tréville saw the queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress. M. de Tréville listened to the young man’s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair. When D’Artagnan had finished, he said, “Hum! All this savors of his Eminence, a league off”.",test,1,2,0,examined see advantage taken sleep found diamond ring finger purse pocket pistols belt rose paid bottle went try could better luck search lackey night first thing perceived damp gray mist honest two horses hand awaited door little blind cabaret passed without even suspicion existence returning directly home alighted door de ran quickly stairs time decided relate passed de would doubtless give good advice whole affair de saw queen almost daily might able draw intelligence poor young woman doubtless making pay dearly devotedness mistress de listened young mans account seriousness proved saw something else adventure besides love affair finished said savors league
5566,"“But what is to be done? ” said D’Artagnan. “Nothing, absolutely nothing, at present, but quitting Paris, as I told you, as soon as possible. I will see the queen; I will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman, of which she is no doubt ignorant. These details will guide her on her part, and on your return, I shall perhaps have some good news to tell you. Rely on me”. D’Artagnan knew that, although a Gascon, M. de Tréville was not in the habit of making promises, and that when by chance he did promise, he more than kept his word. He bowed to him, then, full of gratitude for the past and for the future; and the worthy captain, who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute, pressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey. Determined to put the advice of M. de Tréville in practice instantly, D’Artagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs, in order to superintend the packing of his valise. On approaching the house, he perceived M. Bonacieux in morning costume, standing at his threshold.",test,1,2,0,done said absolutely nothing present quitting told soon possible see queen relate details disappearance poor woman doubt ignorant details guide part return shall perhaps good news tell knew although de habit making promises chance promise kept word bowed full gratitude past future worthy captain side felt lively interest young man brave resolute pressed hand kindly wishing pleasant journey put advice de practice instantly directed course toward des order superintend packing valise approaching house perceived morning costume standing threshold
5567,"All that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of D’Artagnan, who looked at him with more attention than he had done before. In fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might, besides, be accidental, D’Artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance. A rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does; a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith. All falsehood is a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face. It appeared, then, to D’Artagnan that M. Bonacieux wore a mask, and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon. In consequence of this feeling of repugnance, he was about to pass without speaking to him, but, as he had done the day before, M. Bonacieux accosted him. “Well, young man,” said he, “we appear to pass rather gay nights! Seven o’clock in the morning! _Peste! _ You seem to reverse ordinary customs, and come home at the hour when other people are going out”.",test,1,2,0,prudent said preceding evening sinister character old man recurred mind looked attention done fact addition yellow sickly paleness indicates insinuation bile blood might besides accidental remarked something perfidiously significant play wrinkled features countenance rogue laugh way honest man hypocrite shed tears man good faith falsehood mask however well made mask may little attention may always succeed distinguishing true face appeared wore mask likewise mask disagreeable look upon consequence feeling repugnance pass without speaking done day accosted young man said appear pass rather gay nights clock morning seem reverse ordinary customs come home hour people going
5568,"“No one can reproach you for anything of the kind, Monsieur Bonacieux,” said the young man; “you are a model for regular people. It is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife, he has no need to seek happiness elsewhere. Happiness comes to meet him, does it not, Monsieur Bonacieux? ”  Bonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile. “Ah, ah! ” said Bonacieux, “you are a jocular companion! But where the devil were you gladding last night, my young master? It does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads”. D’Artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap. Both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance.",test,1,1,0,one reproach anything kind said young man model regular people true man possesses young pretty wife need seek happiness elsewhere comes meet became pale death grinned ghastly smile ah said jocular companion devil gladding last night young master appear clean crossroads glanced boots covered mud glance fell upon shoes stockings mercer might said dipped mud heap stained splashes mud appearance
5569,"Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of D’Artagnan. That little stout man, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes, treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort, was Bonacieux himself. The husband had presided at the abduction of his wife. A terrible inclination seized D’Artagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him; but, as we have said, he was a very prudent youth, and he restrained himself. However, the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that Bonacieux was terrified at it, and he endeavored to draw back a step or two; but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut, the obstacle compelled him to keep his place. “Ah, but you are joking, my worthy man! ” said D’Artagnan. “It appears to me that if my boots need a sponge, your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush. May you not have been philandering a little also, Monsieur Bonacieux?

5570,"That’s unpardonable in a man of your age, and who besides, has such a pretty wife as yours”. “Oh, Lord! no,” said Bonacieux, “but yesterday I went to St. Mandé to make some inquiries after a servant, as I cannot possibly do without one; and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud, which I have not yet had time to remove”. The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions D’Artagnan had conceived. Bonacieux had named Mandé because Mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from St. Cloud. This probability afforded him his first consolation. If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, one might, by extreme means, force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape. The question, then, was how to change this probability into a certainty. “Pardon, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, if I don’t stand upon ceremony,” said D’Artagnan, “but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep. I am parched with thirst.",test,1,2,0,unpardonable man age besides pretty wife said yesterday went make inquiries servant possibly without one roads bad brought back mud yet time remove place named object journey fresh proof support suspicions conceived named exactly opposite direction probability afforded first consolation knew wife one might extreme means force mercer open teeth let secret escape question change probability certainty dear stand upon ceremony said nothing makes one thirsty want sleep parched thirst
5571,"Allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment; you know that is never refused among neighbors”. Without waiting for the permission of his host, D’Artagnan went quickly into the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. It had not been used. Bonacieux had not been abed. He had only been back an hour or two; he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement, or else at least to the first relay. “Thanks, Monsieur Bonacieux,” said D’Artagnan, emptying his glass, “that is all I wanted of you. I will now go up into my apartment. I will make Planchet brush my boots; and when he has done, I will, if you like, send him to you to brush your shoes”. He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.

The falsehood would then lie at my door, and as I am not a gentleman, I may be allowed to lie”. “Be of good heart, Planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious man.

Indeed, I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of Paris. So then—”  “So then, pack up our luggage, Planchet, and let us be off. On my part, I will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be suspected. You may join me at the Hôtel des Gardes.

5577,"I am a physiognomist, I assure you”. D’Artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. Then, in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps, for the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. No news had been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters, had come for Aramis. D’Artagnan took charge of it. Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the Hôtel des Gardes. D’Artagnan, in order that there might be no time lost, had saddled his horse himself. “That’s well,” said he to Planchet, when the latter added the portmanteau to the equipment. “Now saddle the other three horses”. “Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece?",test,1,1,0,physiognomist assure went first agreed upon order might nothing reproach directed steps last time toward residences three friends news received letter perfumed elegant writing small characters come took charge minutes afterward joined stables des order might time lost saddled horse well said latter added portmanteau equipment saddle three horses think monsieur shall travel faster two horses apiece

As they went from the Hôtel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the street at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barrière de la Villette and the other by the Barrière Montmartre, to meet again beyond St. Denis—a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal punctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. D’Artagnan and Planchet entered Pierrefitte together. Planchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by night. His natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single instant.

5579,"It followed that his hat was forever in his hand, which procured him some severe reprimands from D’Artagnan, who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence. Nevertheless, whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man’s road, our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any accident, and alighted at the tavern of Great St. Martin, the same at which they had stopped on their first journey. The host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses, advanced respectfully to the door. Now, as they had already traveled eleven leagues, D’Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether Porthos were or were not in the inn. Perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these reflections was that D’Artagnan, without asking information of any kind, alighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible—a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight. D’Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity. The regiment of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom; and D’Artagnan, followed by a lackey, and traveling with four magnificent horses, despite the simplicity of his uniform, could not fail to make a sensation. The host desired himself to serve him; which D’Artagnan perceiving, ordered two glasses to be brought, and commenced the following conversation. “My faith, my good host,” said D’Artagnan, filling the two glasses, “I asked for a bottle of your best wine, and if you have deceived me, you will be punished in what you have sinned; for seeing that I hate drinking by myself, you shall drink with me.",test,1,3,0,followed hat forever hand procured severe reprimands feared excess politeness would lead people think lackey man consequence whether passengers really touched urbanity whether time nobody posted young mans road two travelers arrived without accident alighted tavern stopped first journey host seeing young man followed lackey two extra horses advanced respectfully door already traveled eleven leagues thought time stop whether inn would prudent ask become result reflections without asking information kind alighted commended horses care lackey entered small room destined receive wished alone desired host bring bottle best wine good breakfast possible—a desire corroborated high opinion innkeeper formed traveler first sight therefore served miraculous celerity regiment recruited among first gentlemen kingdom followed lackey traveling four magnificent horses despite simplicity uniform could fail make sensation host desired serve perceiving ordered two glasses brought commenced following conversation faith good host said filling two glasses asked bottle best wine deceived punished sinned seeing hate drinking shall drink

Let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment”. “Your Lordship does me much honor,” said the host, “and I thank you sincerely for your kind wish”. “But don’t mistake,” said D’Artagnan, “there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may think—for it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well received. In hôtels that do not flourish, everything is in confusion, and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host. Now, I travel a great deal, particularly on this road, and I wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune”. “It seems to me,” said the host, “that this is not the first time I have had the honor of seeing Monsieur”. “Bah, I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly, and out of the ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least.

My God, my dear host, tell me if anything has happened to him? ”  “Your Lordship must have observed that he could not continue his journey”. “Why, to be sure, he promised to rejoin us, and we have seen nothing of him”. “He has done us the honor to remain here”. “What, he had done you the honor to remain here? ”  “Yes, monsieur, in this house; and we are even a little uneasy—”  “On what account?",test,1,1,1,conducting friends one dispute stranger—a man sought quarrel know said host remember perfectly means companions name dear host tell anything happened must observed could continue journey sure promised rejoin us seen nothing done us honor remain done honor remain monsieur house even little uneasy— account

When we observed this to him, he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business, as this horse belonged to him. We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on; but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman’s word, and that as he had said the horse was his, it must be so”. “That’s Porthos all over,” murmured D’Artagnan. “Then,” continued the host, “I replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment, I hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the Golden Eagle; but Monsieur Porthos replied that, my house being the best, he should remain where he was. This reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure.

Nevertheless, while acknowledging the truth of what he said, I thought proper to insist; but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid it on his table, day and night, and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing, either within the house or out of it, he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself.

At the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor, was traced in black ink a gigantic number “1”. D’Artagnan knocked, and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside, he entered the chamber. Porthos was in bed, and was playing a game at _lansquenet_ with Mousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece, over two chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell. In addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles. At the sight of his friend, Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy; and Mousqueton, rising respectfully, yielded his place to him, and went to give an eye to the two stewpans, of which he appeared to have the particular inspection. “Ah, _pardieu! _ Is that you? ” said Porthos to D’Artagnan.",test,1,2,0,afraid much devil appears words went upstairs leaving host little better satisfied respect two things appeared much interested—his debt life top stairs upon conspicuous door corridor traced black ink gigantic number knocked upon bidding come came inside entered chamber bed playing game keep hand spit loaded partridges turning fire side large chimneypiece two chafing dishes boiling two stewpans exhaled double odor rabbit fish stews rejoicing smell addition perceived top wardrobe marble commode covered empty bottles sight friend uttered loud cry joy rising respectfully yielded place went give eye two stewpans appeared particular inspection said

There is nothing more easy,” said Mousqueton, with a modest air. “One only needs to be sharp, that’s all. I was brought up in the country, and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher”. “And what did he do the rest of his time? ”  “Monsieur, he carried on a trade which I have always thought satisfactory”. “Which? ”  “As it was a time of war between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and as he saw the Catholics exterminate the Huguenots and the Huguenots exterminate the Catholics—all in the name of religion—he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes Catholic, sometimes a Huguenot.",test,1,2,0,must give recipe may besieged turn shall sorry able let enjoy advantages gratify master monsieur nothing easy said modest air needs sharp brought country father leisure time something poacher rest time carried trade always thought satisfactory time war saw exterminate exterminate name religion—he adopted mixed belief permitted sometimes sometimes

He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler; then, when he was within ten paces of him, he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the traveler’s abandoning his purse to save his life. It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming, he felt himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not understand how, a quarter of an hour before, he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion. For my part, monsieur, I am Catholic—my father, faithful to his principles, having made my elder brother a Huguenot”. “And what was the end of this worthy man? ” asked D’Artagnan. “Oh, of the most unfortunate kind, monsieur. One day he was surprised in a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic, with both of whom he had before had business, and who both knew him again; so they united against him and hanged him on a tree.

Two hours after, all was over; we had done the business of both, admiring the foresight of our poor father, who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different religion”. “Well, I must allow, as you say, your father was a very intelligent fellow. And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher? ”  “Yes, monsieur, and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line. The consequence is that when I saw our laborers, which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours, I had recourse to a little of my old trade. While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince, I laid a few snares in the runs; and while reclining on the banks of his Highness’s pieces of water, I slipped a few lines into his fish ponds.

While Porthos and Mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune, D’Artagnan related how Aramis, being wounded, was obliged to stop at Crèvecœur, how he had left Athos fighting at Amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, D’Artagnan, had been forced to run the Comtes de Wardes through the body in order to reach England. But there the confidence of D’Artagnan stopped. He only added that on his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent horses—one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he informed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern. At this moment Planchet entered, to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at Clermont. As D’Artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to Porthos, and as he was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends, he held out his hand to the wounded man, and told him he was about to resume his route in order to continue his researches. For the rest, as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days, if Porthos were still at the Great St. Martin, he would call for him on his way.

D’Artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having again recommended Porthos to the care of Mousqueton, and paid his bill to the host, he resumed his route with Planchet, already relieved of one of his led horses. Chapter XXVI. ARAMIS AND HIS THESIS   D’Artagnan had said nothing to Porthos of his wound or of his procurator’s wife. Our Béarnais was a prudent lad, however young he might be. Consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious Musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret. Besides, we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose. In his projects of intrigue for the future, and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune, D’Artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them. And yet, as he journeyed along, a profound sadness weighed upon his heart.

For himself, he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinal’s vengeance; and, as was well known, the vengeance of his Eminence was terrible. How he had found grace in the eyes of the minister, he did not know; but without doubt M. de Cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the Guards had found him at home. Nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of him who thinks. External existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream. By its influence, time has no longer measure, space has no longer distance. We depart from one place, and arrive at another, that is all. Of the interval passed, nothing remains in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees, mountains, and landscapes are lost. It was as a prey to this hallucination that D’Artagnan traveled, at whatever pace his horse pleased, the six or eight leagues that separated Chantilly from Crèvecœur, without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road.

This time it was not a host but a hostess who received him. D’Artagnan was a physiognomist. His eye took in at a glance the plump, cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place, and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her, or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy. “My good dame,” asked D’Artagnan, “can you tell me what has become of one of my friends, whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago? ”  “A handsome young man, three- or four-and-twenty years old, mild, amiable, and well made? ”  “That is he—wounded in the shoulder”. “Just so.

5612,"But there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé; the defiles of the chamber of Aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of Armida. Bazin was stationed in the corridor, and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that, after many years of trial, Bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been ambitious. In fact, the dream of poor Bazin had always been to serve a churchman; and he awaited with impatience the moment, always in the future, when Aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock. The daily-renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed, had alone kept him in the service of a Musketeer—a service in which, he said, his soul was in constant jeopardy. Bazin was then at the height of joy. In all probability, this time his master would not retract. The union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired. Aramis, suffering at once in body and mind, had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion, and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him; that is to say, the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder. It may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to Bazin than the arrival of D’Artagnan, which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away. He resolved, then, to defend the door bravely; and as, betrayed by the mistress of the inn, he could not say that Aramis was absent, he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference, which had commenced with the morning and would not, as Bazin said, terminate before night.",test,1,3,0,getting place sojourn future abbé defiles chamber well guarded gardens stationed corridor barred passage intrepidity many years trial found near result ever ambitious fact dream poor always serve churchman awaited impatience moment always future would throw aside uniform assume cassock dailyrenewed promise young man moment would long delayed alone kept service service said soul constant jeopardy height joy probability time master would retract union physical pain moral uneasiness produced effect long desired suffering body mind length fixed eyes thoughts upon religion considered warning heaven double accident happened say sudden disappearance mistress wound shoulder may easily understood present disposition master nothing could disagreeable arrival might cast master back vortex mundane affairs long carried away resolved defend door bravely betrayed mistress inn could say absent endeavored prove newcomer would height indiscretion disturb master pious conference commenced morning would said terminate night
5613,"But D’Artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of M. Bazin; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend’s valet, he simply moved him out of the way with one hand, and with the other turned the handle of the door of Number Five. The door opened, and D’Artagnan went into the chamber. Aramis, in a black gown, his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap, not much unlike a _calotte_, was seated before an oblong table, covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio. At his right hand was placed the superior of the Jesuits, and on his left the curate of Montdidier. The curtains were half drawn, and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries. All the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man, particularly when that young man is a Musketeer, had disappeared as if by enchantment; and for fear, no doubt, that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world, Bazin had laid his hands upon sword, pistols, plumed hat, and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts. In their stead D’Artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall. At the noise made by D’Artagnan in entering, Aramis lifted up his head, and beheld his friend; but to the great astonishment of the young man, the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the Musketeer, so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world. “Good day, dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis; “believe me, I am glad to see you”. “So am I delighted to see you,” said D’Artagnan, “although I am not yet sure that it is Aramis I am speaking to”.",test,1,3,0,took little heed eloquent discourse desire support polemic discussion friends valet simply moved way one hand turned handle door door opened went chamber black gown head enveloped sort round flat cap much unlike seated oblong table covered rolls paper enormous volumes folio right hand placed superior left curate curtains half drawn admitted mysterious light calculated beatific reveries mundane objects generally strike eye entering room young man particularly young man disappeared enchantment fear doubt sight might bring master back ideas world laid hands upon sword pistols plumed hat embroideries laces kinds sorts stead thought perceived obscure corner discipline cord suspended nail wall noise made entering lifted head beheld friend great astonishment young man sight produce much effect upon completely mind detached things world day dear said glad see delighted see said yet sure speaking
5614,"“To himself, my friend, to himself! But what makes you doubt it? ”  “I was afraid I had made a mistake in the chamber, and that I had found my way into the apartment of some churchman. Then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen—I was afraid you were dangerously ill”. The two men in black, who guessed D’Artagnan’s meaning, darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening; but D’Artagnan took no heed of it. “I disturb you, perhaps, my dear Aramis,” continued D’Artagnan, “for by what I see, I am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen”. Aramis colored imperceptibly. “You disturb me? Oh, quite the contrary, dear friend, I swear; and as a proof of what I say, permit me to declare I am rejoiced to see you safe and sound”. “Ah, he’ll come round,” thought D’Artagnan; “that’s not bad!",test,1,2,1,friend makes doubt afraid made mistake chamber found way apartment churchman another error seized seeing company gentlemen—i afraid dangerously ill two men black guessed meaning darted glance might thought threatening took heed disturb perhaps dear continued see led believe confessing gentlemen colored imperceptibly disturb quite contrary dear friend swear proof say permit declare rejoiced see safe sound come round thought bad
5615,"”  “This gentleman, who is my friend, has just escaped from a serious danger,” continued Aramis, with unction, pointing to D’Artagnan with his hand, and addressing the two ecclesiastics. “Praise God, monsieur,” replied they, bowing together. “I have not failed to do so, your Reverences,” replied the young man, returning their salutation. “You arrive in good time, dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, “and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence. Monsieur the Principal of Amiens, Monsieur the Curate of Montdidier, and I are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested; I shall be delighted to have your opinion”. “The opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight,” replied D’Artagnan, who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking, “and you had better be satisfied, believe me, with the knowledge of these gentlemen”. The two men in black bowed in their turn. “On the contrary,” replied Aramis, “your opinion will be very valuable. The question is this: Monsieur the Principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic”. “Your thesis!",test,1,2,0,gentleman friend escaped serious danger continued unction pointing hand addressing two ecclesiastics monsieur replied bowing together failed replied young man returning salutation arrive good time dear said taking part discussion may assist us intelligence arguing certain theological questions much interested shall delighted opinion opinion swordsman little weight replied began uneasy turn things taking better satisfied believe knowledge gentlemen two men black bowed turn contrary replied opinion valuable question thinks thesis ought dogmatic didactic thesis
5616,"Are you then making a thesis? ”  “Without doubt,” replied the Jesuit. “In the examination which precedes ordination, a thesis is always a requisite”. “Ordination! ” cried D’Artagnan, who could not believe what the hostess and Bazin had successively told him; and he gazed, half stupefied, upon the three persons before him. “Now,” continued Aramis, taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed, and complacently examining his hand, which was as white and plump as that of a woman, and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend, “now, as you have heard, D’Artagnan, Monsieur the Principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic, while I, for my part, would rather it should be ideal. This is the reason why Monsieur the Principal has proposed to me the following subject, which has not yet been treated upon, and in which I perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration—‘_Utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_. ’”  D’Artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of M. de Tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that D’Artagnan had received from the Duke of Buckingham. “Which means,” resumed Aramis, that he might perfectly understand, “‘The two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders, when they bestow the benediction. ’”  “An admirable subject!",test,1,3,0,making thesis doubt replied examination precedes ordination thesis always requisite cried could believe hostess successively told gazed half stupefied upon three persons continued taking graceful position easy chair would assumed bed complacently examining hand white plump woman held air cause blood descend heard desirous thesis dogmatic part would rather ideal reason proposed following subject yet treated upon perceive matter magnificent elaboration—utraque manus benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est whose erudition well acquainted evinced interest hearing quotation de allusion gifts pretended received means resumed might perfectly understand two hands indispensable priests inferior orders bestow benediction admirable subject
5617,"” cried the Jesuit. “Admirable and dogmatic! ” repeated the curate, who, about as strong as D’Artagnan with respect to Latin, carefully watched the Jesuit in order to keep step with him, and repeated his words like an echo. As to D’Artagnan, he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black. “Yes, admirable! _prorsus admirabile! _” continued Aramis; “but which requires a profound study of both the Scriptures and the Fathers. Now, I have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics, and that in all humility, that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little. I should find myself, therefore, more at my ease, _facilius natans_, in a subject of my own choice, which would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to metaphysics in philosophy”.

5618,"“See what an exordium! ” cried the Jesuit. “Exordium,” repeated the curate, for the sake of saying something. “_Quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem_”. Aramis cast a glance upon D’Artagnan to see what effect all this produced, and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws. “Let us speak French, my father,” said he to the Jesuit; “Monsieur d’Artagnan will enjoy our conversation better”. “Yes,” replied D’Artagnan; “I am fatigued with reading, and all this Latin confuses me”. “Certainly,” replied the Jesuit, a little put out, while the curate, greatly delighted, turned upon D’Artagnan a look full of gratitude. “Well, let us see what is to be derived from this gloss. Moses, the servant of God—he was but a servant, please to understand—Moses blessed with the hands; he held out both his arms while the Hebrews beat their enemies, and then he blessed them with his two hands.",test,1,2,0,exordium cried repeated curate sake saying something inter cœlorum immensitatem cast glance upon see effect produced found friend gaping enough split jaws us speak father said dartagnan enjoy conversation better replied fatigued reading confuses replied little put curate greatly delighted turned upon look full gratitude let us see derived gloss servant servant please understand—moses blessed hands held arms beat enemies blessed two hands
5619,"Besides, what does the Gospel say? _Imponite manus_, and not _manum_—place the _hands_, not the _hand_”. “Place the _hands_,” repeated the curate, with a gesture. “St. Peter, on the contrary, of whom the Popes are the successors,” continued the Jesuit; “_porrige digitos_—present the fingers. Are you there, now? ”  “_Certes_,” replied Aramis, in a pleased tone, “but the thing is subtle”. “The _fingers_,” resumed the Jesuit, “St. Peter blessed with the _fingers_. The Pope, therefore blesses with the fingers. And with how many fingers does he bless? With _three_ fingers, to be sure—one for the Father, one for the Son, and one for the Holy Ghost”.",test,1,1,0,say manus repeated curate gesture contrary successors continued digitos—present fingers replied pleased tone thing subtle resumed blessed therefore blesses fingers many fingers bless fingers sure—one one one
5620,"All crossed themselves. D’Artagnan thought it was proper to follow this example. “The Pope is the successor of St. Peter, and represents the three divine powers; the rest—_ordines inferiores_—of the ecclesiastical hierarchy bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels. The most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans, bless with holy water sprinklers, which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers. There is the subject simplified. _Argumentum omni denudatum ornamento_. I could make of that subject two volumes the size of this,” continued the Jesuit; and in his enthusiasm he struck a St. Chrysostom in folio, which made the table bend beneath its weight. D’Artagnan trembled. “_Certes_,” said Aramis, “I do justice to the beauties of this thesis; but at the same time I perceive it would be overwhelming for me. I had chosen this text—tell me, dear D’Artagnan, if it is not to your taste—‘_Non inutile est desiderium in oblatione_’; that is, ‘A little regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the Lord.",test,1,2,0,crossed thought proper follow example successor represents three divine powers rest—ordines inferiores—of ecclesiastical hierarchy bless name holy archangels angels humble clerks deacons sacristans bless holy water sprinklers resemble infinite number blessing fingers subject simplified omni denudatum ornamento could make subject two volumes size continued enthusiasm struck folio made table bend beneath weight trembled said justice beauties thesis time perceive would overwhelming chosen text—tell dear taste—non inutile est desiderium oblatione little regret unsuitable offering
5621,"’”  “Stop there! ” cried the Jesuit, “for that thesis touches closely upon heresy. There is a proposition almost like it in the _Augustinus_ of the heresiarch Jansenius, whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner. Take care, my young friend. You are inclining toward false doctrines, my young friend; you will be lost”. “You will be lost,” said the curate, shaking his head sorrowfully. “You approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock. You face the insinuations of the Pelagians and the semi-Pelagians”. “But, my Reverend—” replied Aramis, a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head. “How will you prove,” continued the Jesuit, without allowing him time to speak, “that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to God?",test,1,1,0,cried thesis touches closely upon heresy proposition almost like heresiarch whose book sooner later burned hands executioner care young friend inclining toward false doctrines young friend lost lost said curate shaking head sorrowfully approach famous point free mortal rock face insinuations semipelagians replied little amazed shower arguments poured upon head prove continued without allowing time speak ought regret world offer
5622,"Listen to this dilemma: God is God, and the world is the devil. To regret the world is to regret the devil; that is my conclusion”. “And that is mine also,” said the curate. “But, for heaven’s sake—” resumed Aramis. “_Desideras diabolum_, unhappy man! ” cried the Jesuit. “He regrets the devil! Ah, my young friend,” added the curate, groaning, “do not regret the devil, I implore you! ”  D’Artagnan felt himself bewildered. It seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse, and was becoming as mad as those he saw.",test,1,1,0,dilemma world devil regret world regret devil conclusion mine also said curate heavens sake— resumed diabolum unhappy man cried regrets devil young friend added curate groaning regret devil implore felt bewildered seemed though madhouse becoming mad saw
5623,"He was, however, forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed. “But listen to me, then,” resumed Aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience. “I do not say I regret; no, I will never pronounce that sentence, which would not be orthodox”. The Jesuit raised his hands toward heaven, and the curate did the same. “No; but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the Lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted! Don’t you think so, D’Artagnan? ”  “I think so, indeed,” cried he. The Jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs. “This is the point of departure; it is a syllogism. The world is not wanting in attractions.",test,1,1,0,however forced hold tongue comprehending half language employed listen resumed politeness mingled little impatience say regret never pronounce sentence would orthodox raised hands toward heaven curate pray grant acting ill grace offer perfectly disgusted think think indeed cried curate quite started chairs point departure syllogism world wanting attractions
5624,"I quit the world; then I make a sacrifice. Now, the Scripture says positively, ‘Make a sacrifice unto the Lord. ’”  “That is true,” said his antagonists. “And then,” said Aramis, pinching his ear to make it red, as he rubbed his hands to make them white, “and then I made a certain _rondeau_ upon it last year, which I showed to Monsieur Voiture, and that great man paid me a thousand compliments”. “A _rondeau! _” said the Jesuit, disdainfully. “A _rondeau! _” said the curate, mechanically. “Repeat it!

I will see about the continuation of it, and tomorrow I hope you will be satisfied with the corrections I shall have made in consequence of your advice”. “Work slowly,” said the curate; “we leave you in an excellent tone of mind”. “Yes, the ground is all sown,” said the Jesuit, “and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone, another upon the highway, or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest, _aves cœli comederunt illam_”. “Plague stifle you and your Latin! ” said D’Artagnan, who began to feel all his patience exhausted. “Farewell, my son,” said the curate, “till tomorrow”. “Till tomorrow, rash youth,” said the Jesuit. “You promise to become one of the lights of the Church.

The two men in black rose, bowed to Aramis and D’Artagnan, and advanced toward the door. Bazin, who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation, sprang toward them, took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the Jesuit, and walked respectfully before them to clear their way. Aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs, and then immediately came up again to D’Artagnan, whose senses were still in a state of confusion. When left alone, the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence. It however became necessary for one of them to break it first, and as D’Artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion, Aramis said, “you see that I am returned to my fundamental ideas”. “Yes, efficacious grace has touched you, as that gentleman said just now”. “Oh, these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time.

D’Artagnan, who, foreseeing such an event, had kept his eye on him, sprang toward him, caught him in his arms, and assisted him to his chamber. “That’s all right, my dear Aramis, take care of yourself,” said he; “I will go alone in search of Athos”. “You are a man of brass,” replied Aramis. “No, I have good luck, that is all.

They took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and Bazin, D’Artagnan was trotting along in the direction of Amiens.

5653,"This idea, while darkening his brow, drew several sighs from him, and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance. Of all his friends, Athos was the eldest, and the least resembling him in appearance, in his tastes and sympathies. Yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman. The noble and distinguished air of Athos, those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself, that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world, that forced and cynical gaiety, that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness—such qualities attracted more than the esteem, more than the friendship of D’Artagnan; they attracted his admiration. Indeed, when placed beside M. de Tréville, the elegant and noble courtier, Athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison. He was of middle height; but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with Porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the Musketeers. His head, with piercing eyes, a straight nose, a chin cut like that of Brutus, had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace. His hands, of which he took little care, were the despair of Aramis, who cultivated his with almond paste and perfumed oil. The sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in Athos, who was always retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society—those manners of a high degree which appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his least actions. If a repast were on foot, Athos presided over it better than any other, placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned for him or that he had made for himself.",test,1,3,0,idea darkening brow drew several sighs caused formulate vows vengeance friends eldest least resembling appearance tastes sympathies entertained marked preference gentleman noble distinguished air flashes greatness time time broke shade voluntarily kept unalterable equality temper made pleasant companion world forced cynical gaiety bravery might termed blind result rarest coolness—such qualities attracted esteem friendship attracted admiration placed beside de elegant noble courtier cheerful days might advantageously sustain comparison middle height person admirably shaped well proportioned struggles overcome giant whose physical strength proverbial among head piercing eyes straight nose chin cut like altogether indefinable character grandeur grace hands took little care despair cultivated almond paste perfumed oil sound voice penetrating melodious inconceivable always retiring delicate knowledge world usages brilliant society—those manners high degree appeared unconsciously least actions repast foot presided better placing every guest exactly rank ancestors earned made

And before the poet knew it, he emerged, after the quiet of Spiridonovka, by the Nikitsky Gate, where his situation worsened. The place was swarming with people. Besides, the gang of villains decided to apply the favourite trick of bandits here: a scattered getaway. The choirmaster, with great dexterity, bored his way on to a bus speeding towards the Arbat Square and slipped away. Having lost one of his quarries, Ivan focused his attention on the cat and saw this strange cat go up to the footboard of an  'A' tram waiting at a stop, brazenly elbow aside a woman, who screamed, grab hold of the handrail, and even make an attempt to shove a ten-kopeck piece into the conductress's hand through the window, open on account of the stuffiness. Ivan was so struck by the cat's behaviour that he froze motionless by the grocery store on the corner, and here he was struck for a second time, but much more strongly, by the conductress's behaviour.

'  Neither the conductress nor the passengers were struck by the essence of the matter: not just that a cat was boarding a tram-car, which would have been good enough, but that he was going to pay! The cat turned out to be not only a solvent but also a disciplined animal. At the very first shout from the conductress, he halted his advance, got off the footboard, and sat down at the stop, rubbing his whiskers with the ten-kopeck piece. But as soon as the conductress yanked the cord and the tram-car started moving off, the cat acted like anyone who has been expelled from a tram-car but still needs a ride. Letting all three cars go by, the cat jumped on to the rear coupling-pin of the last one, wrapped its paws around some hose sticking out of the side, and rode off, thus saving himself ten kopecks. Occupied with the obnoxious cat, Ivan almost lost the main one of the three - the professor. But, fortunately, the man had not managed to slip away.

5658,"However, he had no luck. The poet would quicken his pace, break into a trot, shove passers-by, yet not get an inch closer to the professor. Upset as he was, Ivan was still struck by the supernatural speed of the chase. Twenty seconds had not gone by when, after the Nikitsky Gate, Ivan Nikolayevich was already dazzled by the lights of the Arbat Square. Another few seconds, and here was some dark lane with slanting sidewalks, where Ivan Nikolaevich took a tumble and hurt his knee.

5659,"Bursting into the entrance, Ivan Nikolaevich flew up to the second floor, immediately found the apartment, and rang impatiently. He did not have to wait long. Some little girl of about five opened the door for Ivan and, without asking him anything, immediately went away somewhere. In the huge, extremely neglected front hall, weakly lit by a tiny carbon arc lamp under the high ceiling, black with grime, a bicycle without tyres hung on the wall, a huge iron-bound trunk stood, and on a shelf over the coat rack a winter hat lay, its long ear-flaps hanging down. Behind one of the doors, a resonant male voice was angrily shouting something in verse from a radio set. Ivan Nikolaevich was not the least at a loss in the unfamiliar surroundings and rushed straight into the corridor, reasoning thus:  'Of course, he's hiding in the bathroom. '  The corridor was dark. Having bumped into the wall a few times, Ivan saw a faint streak of light under a door, felt for the handle, and pulled it gently.

5660,"Ivan met with a wave of humid heat and, by the light of the coals smouldering in the boiler, made out big basins hanging on the walls, and a bath tub, all black frightful blotches where the enamel had chipped off. And there, in this bath tub, stood a naked citizeness, all soapy and with a scrubber in her hand. She squinted near-sightedly at the bursting-in Ivan and, obviously mistaking him in the infernal light, said softly and gaily:  'Kiriushka! Stop this tomfoolery! Have you lost your mind? ...  Fyodor Ivanych will be back any minute. Get out right now! ' and she waved at Ivan with the scrubber. The misunderstanding was evident, and Ivan Nikolaevich was, of course, to blame for it.

'  A single moonbeam, having seeped through the dusty, perennially unwashed window, shone sparsely into the corner where, in dust and cobwebs, a forgotten icon hung, with the ends of two wedding candles [2] peeking out from behind its casing. Under the big icon, pinned to it, hung a little one made of paper. No one knows what thought took hold of Ivan here, but before running out the back door, he appropriated one of these candles, as well as the paper icon. With these objects, he left the unknown apartment, muttering something, embarrassed at the thought of what he had just experienced in the bathroom, involuntarily trying to guess who this impudent Kiriushka might be and whether the disgusting hat with ear-flaps belonged to him. In the desolate, joyless lane the poet looked around, searching for the fugitive, but he was nowhere to be seen. Then Ivan said firmly to himself:  'Why, of course, he's at the Moscow River! Onward!

5662,"But the trouble was that there was no one to ask him. The loathsome lane was completely empty. In the very shortest time, Ivan Nikolaevich could be seen on the granite steps of the Moscow River amphitheatre. [3]  Having taken off his clothes, Ivan entrusted them to a pleasant, bearded fellow who was smoking a hand-rolled cigarette, sitting beside a torn white Tolstoy blouse and a pair of unlaced, worn boots. After waving his arms to cool off, Ivan dived swallow-fashion into the water. It took his breath away, so cold the water was, and the thought even flashed in him that he might not manage to come up to the surface. However, he did manage to come up, and, puffing and snorting, his eyes rounded in terror, Ivan Nikolaevich began swimming through the black, oil-smelling water among the broken zigzags of street lights on the bank. When the wet Ivan came dancing back up the steps to the place where the bearded fellow was guarding his clothes, it became clear that not only the latter, but also the former - that is, the bearded fellow himself - had been stolen. In the exact spot where the pile of clothes had been, a pair of striped drawers, the torn Tolstoy blouse, the candle, the icon and a box of matches had been left.

5663,"Here two considerations began to trouble him: first, that his Massolit identification card, which he never parted with, was gone, and, second, whether he could manage to get through Moscow unhindered looking the way he did now? In striped drawers, after all ... True, it was nobody's business, but still there might be some hitch or delay. Ivan tore off the buttons where the drawers fastened at the ankle, figuring that this way they might pass for summer trousers, gathered up the icon, the candle and the matches, and started off, saying to himself:  'To Griboedov's! Beyond all doubt, he's there. '  The city was already living its evening life. Trucks flew through the dust, chains clanking, and on their platforms men lay sprawled belly up on sacks. All windows were open. In each of these windows a light burned under an orange lampshade, and from every window, every door, every gateway, roof, and attic, basement and courtyard blared the hoarse roar of the polonaise from the opera Evgeny Onegin. [4]  Ivan Nikolaevich's apprehensions proved fully justified: passers-by did pay attention to him and turned their heads. As a result, he took the decision to leave the main streets and make his way through back lanes, where people are not so importunate, where there were fewer chances of them picking on a barefoot man, pestering him with questions about his drawers, which stubbornly refused to look like trousers.",test,2,3,0,two considerations began trouble first identification card never parted gone second whether could manage get unhindered looking way striped drawers nobodys business still might hitch delay tore buttons drawers fastened ankle figuring way might pass summer trousers gathered icon candle matches started saying doubt hes city already living evening life flew dust chains clanking platforms men lay sprawled belly sacks windows open windows light burned orange lampshade every window every door every gateway roof attic basement courtyard blared hoarse roar polonaise opera apprehensions proved fully justified passersby pay attention turned heads result took decision leave main streets make way back lanes people importunate fewer chances picking barefoot man pestering questions drawers stubbornly refused look like trousers
5664,"This Ivan did, and, penetrating the mysterious network of lanes around the Arbat, he began making his way along the walls, casting fearful sidelong glances, turning around every moment, hiding in gateways from time to time, avoiding intersections with traffic lights and the grand entrances of embassy mansions. And all along his difficult way, he was for some reason inexpressibly tormented by the ubiquitous orchestra that accompanied the heavy basso singing about his love for Tatiana. CHAPTER 5  There were Doings at Griboedov's  The old, two-storeyed, cream-coloured house stood on the ring boulevard, in the depths of a seedy garden, separated from the sidewalk by a fancy cast-iron fence. The small terrace in front of the house was paved with asphalt, and in wintertime was dominated by a snow pile with a shovel stuck in it, but in summertime turned into the most magnificent section of the summer restaurant under a canvas tent. The house was called `The House of Griboedov' on the grounds that it was alleged to have once belonged to an aunt of the writer Alexander Sergeevich Griboedov. [1] Now, whether it did or did not belong to her, we do not exactly know. On recollection, it even seems that Griboedov never had any such house-owning aunt... Nevertheless, that was what the house was called.

Who will speak in defence of envy? This feeling belongs to the nasty category, but all the same one must put oneself in the visitor's position. For what he had seen on the upper floor was not all, and was far from all. The entire ground floor of the aunt's house was occupied by a restaurant, and what a restaurant! It was justly considered the best in Moscow. And not only because it took up two vast halls with arched ceilings, painted with violet, Assyrian-maned horses, not only because on each table there stood a lamp shaded with a shawl, not only because it was not accessible to just anybody coming in off the street, but because in the quality of its fare Griboedov's beat any restaurant in Moscow up and down, and this fare was available at the most reasonable, by no means onerous, price.

On the first lay the naked body, covered with dried blood, one arm broken, the chest caved in; on the second, the head with the front teeth knocked out, with dull, open eyes unafraid of the brightest light; and on the third, a pile of stiffened rags. Near the beheaded body stood a professor of forensic medicine, a pathological anatomist and his dissector, representatives of the investigation, and Mikhail Alexandrovich's assistant in Massolit, the writer Zheldybin, summoned by telephone from his sick wife's side. A car had come for Zheldybin and first of all taken him together with the investigators (this was around midnight) to the dead man's apartment, where the sealing of his papers had been carried out, after which they all went to the morgue.

Those sitting at the tables began to get up and peer at it, and saw that along with the little light a white ghost was marching towards the restaurant.

The shirt-front and tailcoat disappeared and a pistol butt emerged, tucked into a leather belt. The doorman pictured himself hanging from the fore-topsail yard.

5693,"Ivan Nikolaevich's arms and legs were free. Seeing the entering man, Riukhin turned pale, coughed, and said timidly:  'Hello, Doctor. '  The doctor bowed to Riukhin but, as he bowed, looked not at him but at Ivan Nikolaevich. The latter sat perfectly motionless, with an angry face and knitted brows, and did not even stir at the doctor's entrance. 'Here, Doctor,' Riukhin began speaking, for some reason, in a mysterious whisper, glancing timorously at Ivan Nikolaevich, `is the renowned poet Ivan Homeless ... well, you see ... we're afraid it might be delirium tremens...'  'Was he drinking hard? ' the doctor said through his teeth. 'No, he drank, but not really so...'  'Did he chase after cockroaches, rats, little devils, or slinking dogs?

'  'He fell off a fence, and then in the restaurant he hit somebody... and then somebody else...'  'So, so, so,' the doctor said and, turning to Ivan, added: 'Hello there! '  'Greetings, saboteur! [1]' Ivan replied spitefully and loudly. Riukhin was so embarrassed that he did not dare raise his eyes to the courteous doctor. But the latter, not offended in the least, took off his glasses with a habitual, deft movement, raised the skirt of his coat, put them into the back pocket of his trousers, and then asked Ivan:  'How old are you?

' he adverted separately to Riukhin. 'And what do you want to complain about? '  'About the fact that I, a healthy man, was seized and dragged by force to a madhouse! ' Ivan replied wrathfully. Here Riukhin looked closely at Ivan and went cold: there was decidedly no insanity in the man's eyes.

'You are,' the doctor began calmly, sitting down on a white stool with a shiny foot, `not in a madhouse, but in a clinic, where no one will keep you if it's not necessary. '  Ivan Nikolaevich glanced at him mistrustfully out of the corner of his eye, but still grumbled:  'Thank the Lord! One normal man has finally turned up among the idiots, of whom the first is that giftless goof Sashka! '  'Who is this giftless Sashka? ' the doctor inquired.

5697,"The latter flushed with indignation. That's the thanks I get,' he thought bitterly, 'for showing concern for him! What trash, really! '  'Psychologically, a typical little kulak,'[2] Ivan Nikolaevich began, evidently from an irresistible urge to denounce Riukhin, 'and, what's more, a little kulak carefully disguising himself as a proletarian. Look at his lenten physiognomy, and compare it with those resounding verses he wrote for the First of May [3] - heh, heh, heh ...  ""Soaring up""! and ""Soaring down! ""! But if you could look inside him and see what he thinks... you'd gasp! ' And Ivan Nikolaevich burst into sinister laughter.

'  'May I ask why you came to the restaurant in just your underwear?

' Here the doctor turned and sent a glance towards a woman in a white coat, who was sitting at a table to one side. She took out a sheet of paper and began filling in the blank spaces in its columns.

'But the thing is that he, the consultant, he... let's speak directly... is mixed up with the unclean powers... and you won't catch him so easily.

'Well, so I pinned the icon on my chest and ran...'  Here the clock suddenly struck twice. 'Oh-oh! ' Ivan exclaimed and got up from the couch. `It's two o'clock, and I'm wasting time with you!

' Ivan said, turning around with a wild and hunted look. 'Well, then...  Goodbye! ' And he rushed head first into the window-blind. The crash was rather forceful, but the glass behind the blind gave no crack, and in an instant Ivan Nikolaevich was struggling in the hands of the orderlies.

There was a smell of ether, Ivan went limp in the hands of the four people, the deft doctor took advantage of this moment and stuck the needle into Ivan's arm. They held Ivan for another few seconds and then lowered him on to the couch. 'Bandits! ' Ivan shouted and jumped up from the couch, but was installed on it again. The moment they let go of him, he again jumped up, but sat back down by himself. He paused, gazing around wildly, then unexpectedly yawned, then smiled maliciously. 'Locked me up after all,' he said, yawned again, unexpectedly lay down, put his head on the pillow, his fist under his head like a child, and muttered now in a sleepy voice, without malice: 'Very well, then... you'll pay for it yourselves...  I've warned you, you can do as you like...  I'm now interested most of all in Pontius Pilate ... Pilate...', and he closed his eyes. 'A bath, a private room, number 117, and a nurse to watch him,' the doctor ordered as he put his glasses on.

5708,"Out of the corridor rolled a stretcher on rubber wheels, to which the quieted Ivan was transferred, and then he rolled off down the corridor and the door closed behind him. 'Doctor,' the shaken Riukhin asked in a whisper, 'it means he's really ill? '  'Oh, yes,' replied the doctor. 'But what's wrong with him, then? ' Riukhin asked timidly. The tired doctor glanced at Riukhin and answered listlessly:  'Locomotor and speech excitation... delirious interpretations... A complex case, it seems. Schizophrenia, I suppose. Plus this alcoholism...'  Riukhin understood nothing from the doctor's words, except that things were evidently not so great with Ivan Nikolaevich.

5709,"Or maybe a hallucination...'  A few minutes later the truck was carrying Riukhin off to Moscow. Day was breaking, and the light of the street lights still burning along the highway was now unnecessary and unpleasant. The driver was vexed at having wasted the night, drove the truck as fast as he could, and skidded on the turns. Now the woods dropped off, stayed somewhere behind, and the river went somewhere to the side, and an omnium gatherum came spilling to meet the truck: fences with sentry boxes and stacks of wood, tall posts and some sort of poles, with spools strung on the poles, heaps of rubble, the earth scored by canals - in short, you sensed that she was there, Moscow, right there, around the turn, and about to heave herself upon you and engulf you. Riukhin was jolted and tossed about; the sort of stump he had placed himself on kept trying to slide out from under him. The restaurant napkins, thrown in by the policeman and Pantelei, who had left earlier by bus, moved all around the flatbed. Riukhin tried to collect them, but then, for some reason hissing spitefully:  'Devil take them!

5710,"It was becoming clear that his visit to the house of sorrow had left the deepest mark on him. Riukhin tried to understand what was tormenting him. The corridor with blue lights, which had stuck itself to his memory? The thought that there is no greater misfortune in the world than the loss of reason? Yes, yes, of course, that, too.

The poet no longer looked around, but, staring into the dirty, shaking floor, began muttering something, whining, gnawing at himself. Yes, poetry... He was thirty-two years old!

'I don't believe in anything I write! ...'  Poisoned by this burst of neurasthenia, the poet swayed, the floor under him stopped shaking. Riukhin raised his head and saw that he had long been in Moscow, and, what's more, that it was dawn over Moscow, that the cloud was underlit with gold, that his truck had stopped, caught in a column of other vehicles at the turn on to the boulevard, and that very close to him on a pedestal stood a metal man [4], his head inclined slightly, gazing at the boulevard with indifference.

In no more than two minutes, the completely ill and even aged poet was entering the veranda of Griboedov's. It was now empty.

5714,"Riukhin, laden with napkins, was met affably by Archibald Archibaldovich and at once relieved of the cursed rags. Had Riukhin not become so worn out in the clinic and on the truck, he would certainly have derived pleasure from telling how everything had gone in the hospital and embellishing the story with invented details. But just then he was far from such things, and, little observant though Riukhin was, now, after the torture on the truck, he peered keenly at the pirate for the first time and realized that, though the man asked about Homeless and even exclaimed  'Ai-yai-yai! ', he was essentially quite indifferent to Homeless's fate and did not feel a bit sorry for him. 'And bravo! Right you are! ' Riukhin thought with cynical, self-annihilating malice and, breaking off the story about the schizophrenia, begged:  `Archibald Archibaldovich, a drop of vodka...'  The pirate made a compassionate face and whispered:  'I understand... this very minute...' and beckoned to a waiter. A quarter of an hour later, Riukhin sat in complete solitude, hunched over his bream, drinking glass after glass, understanding and recognizing that it was no longer possible to set anything right in his life, that it was only possible to forget.

A heavy bell was booming in that head, brown spots rimmed with fiery green floated between his eyeballs and his closed eyelids, and to crown it all he was nauseous, this nausea, as it seemed to him, being connected with the sounds of some importunate gramophone. Styopa tried to recall something, but only one thing would get recalled - that yesterday, apparently, and in some unknown place, he had stood with a napkin in his hand and tried to kiss some lady, promising her that the next day, and exactly at noon, he would come to visit her.

He attempted to learn this last at least, and to that end unstuck the stuck-together lids of his left eye. Something gleamed dully in the semi-darkness. Styopa finally recognized the pier-glass and realized that he was lying on his back in his own bed - that is, the jeweller's wife's former bed - in the bedroom. Here he felt such a throbbing in his head that he closed his eyes and moaned.

5717,"Anna Frantsevna de Fougeray, a respectable and very practical fifty-year-old woman, let out three of the five rooms to lodgers: one whose last name was apparently Belomut, and another with a lost last name. And then two years ago inexplicable events began to occur in this apartment: people began to disappear [1] from this apartment without a trace. Once, on a day off, a policeman came to the apartment, called the second lodger (the one whose last name got lost) out to the front hall, and said he was invited to come to the police station for a minute to put his signature to something. The lodger told Anfisa, Anna Frantsevna's long-time and devoted housekeeper, to say, in case he received any telephone calls, that he would be back in ten minutes, and left together with the proper, white-gloved policeman. He not only did not come back in ten minutes, but never came back at all. The most surprising thing was that the policeman evidently vanished along with him. The pious, or, to speak more frankly, superstitious Anfisa declared outright to the very upset Anna Frantsevna that it was sorcery and that she knew perfectly well who had stolen both the lodger and the policeman, only she did not wish to talk about it towards night-time.

5718,"Madame Belomut's grief and horror defied description. But, alas, neither the one nor the other continued for long. That same night, on returning with Anfisa from her dacha, which Anna Frantsevna had hurried off to for some reason, she did not find the wife of citizen Belomut in the apartment. And not only that: the doors of the two rooms occupied by the Belomut couple turned out to be sealed. Two days passed somehow. On the third day, Anna Frantsevna, who had suffered all the while from insomnia, again left hurriedly for her dacha... Needless to say, she never came back! Left alone, Anfisa, having wept her fill, went to sleep past one o'clock in the morning. What happened to her after that is not known, but lodgers in other apartments told of hearing some sort of knocking all night in no. 50 and of seeing electric light burning in the windows till morning.

5719,"For a long time all sorts of legends were repeated in the house about these disappearances and about the accursed apartment, such as, for instance, 'that this dry and pious little Anfisa had supposedly carried on her dried-up breast, in a suede bag, twenty-five big diamonds belonging to Anna Frantsevna. That in the woodshed of that very dacha to which Anna Frantsevna had gone so hurriedly, there supposedly turned up, of themselves, some inestimable treasures in the form of those same diamonds, plus some gold coins of tsarist minting... And so on, in the same vein. Well, what we don't know, we can't vouch for. However it may have been, the apartment stood empty and sealed for only a week. Then the late Berlioz moved in with his wife, and this same Styopa, also with his wife. It was perfectly natural that, as soon as they got into the malignant apartment, devil knows what started happening with them as well! Namely, within the space of a month both wives vanished. But these two not without a trace. Of Berlioz's wife it was told that she had supposedly been seen in Kharkov with some ballet-master, while Styopa's wife allegedly turned up on Bozhedomka Street, where wagging tongues said the director of the Variety, using his innumerable acquaintances, had contrived to get her a room, but on the one condition that she never show her face on Sadovaya...  And so, Styopa moaned. He wanted to call the housekeeper Grunya and ask her for aspirin, but was still able to realize that it was foolish, and that Grunya, of course, had no aspirin.",test,2,3,0,long time sorts legends repeated house disappearances accursed apartment instance dry pious little supposedly carried driedup breast suede bag twentyfive big diamonds belonging woodshed dacha gone hurriedly supposedly turned inestimable treasures form diamonds plus gold coins tsarist minting vein dont know cant vouch may apartment stood empty sealed week late moved wife also wife perfectly natural soon got malignant apartment devil knows started happening well within space month wives vanished two without trace wife told supposedly seen balletmaster wife allegedly turned wagging tongues said director using innumerable acquaintances contrived get room one condition never show face moaned wanted call housekeeper ask aspirin still able realize foolish course aspirin
5720,"He tried to call Berlioz for help, groaned twice:  'Misha... Misha...', but, as you will understand, received no reply. The apartment was perfectly silent. Moving his toes, Styopa realized that he was lying there in his socks, passed his trembling hand down his hip to determine whether he had his trousers on or not, but failed. Finally, seeing that he was abandoned and alone, and there was no one to help him, he decided to get up, however inhuman the effort it cost him. Styopa unstuck his glued eyelids and saw himself reflected in the pier-glass as a man with hair sticking out in all directions, with a bloated physiognomy covered with black stubble, with puffy eyes, a dirty shirt, collar and necktie, in drawers and socks. So he saw himself in the pier-glass, and next to the mirror he saw an unknown man, dressed in black and wearing a black beret. Styopa sat up in bed and goggled his bloodshot eyes as well as he could at the unknown man. The silence was broken by this unknown man, who said in a low, heavy voice, and with a foreign accent, the following words:  'Good morning, my most sympathetic Stepan Bogdanovich! '  There was a pause, after which, making a most terrible strain on himself, Styopa uttered:  ""What can I do for you?

5721,"He spoke the word 'what' in a treble, 'can I' in a bass, and his 'do for you' did not come off at all. The stranger smiled amicably, took out a big gold watch with a diamond triangle on the lid, rang eleven times, and said:  'Eleven. And for exactly an hour I've been waiting for you to wake up, since you made an appointment for me to come to your place at ten. Here I am! '[2]  Styopa felt for his trousers on the chair beside his bed, whispered:  'Excuse me...', put them on, and asked hoarsely: 'Tell me your name, please? '  He had difficulty speaking.

5722,"`Forgive me...' Styopa croaked, feeling that his hangover had presented him with a new symptom: it seemed to him that the floor beside his bed went away, and that at any moment he would go flying down to the devil's dam in the nether world. `My dear Stepan Bogdanovich,' the visitor said, with a perspicacious smile, 'no aspirin will help you. Follow the wise old rule - cure like with like. The only thing that will bring you back to life is two glasses of vodka with something pickled and hot to go with it. '  Styopa was a shrewd man and, sick as he was, realized that since he had been found in this state, he would have to confess everything. `Frankly speaking,' he began, his tongue barely moving, 'yesterday I got a bit...'  'Not a word more! ' the visitor answered and drew aside with his chair. Styopa, rolling his eyes, saw that a tray had been set on a small table, on which tray there were sliced white bread, pressed caviar in a little bowl, pickled mushrooms on a dish, something in a saucepan, and, finally, vodka in a roomy decanter belonging to the jeweller's wife. What struck Styopa especially was that the decanter was frosty with cold.

5723,"In short, the service was neat, efficient. The stranger did not allow Styopa's amazement to develop to a morbid degree, but deftly poured him half a glass of vodka. 'And you? ' Styopa squeaked. 'With pleasure! '  His hand twitching, Styopa brought the glass to his lips, while the stranger swallowed the contents of his glass at one gulp. Chewing a lump of caviar, Styopa squeezed out of himself the words:  'And you... a bite of something? '  `Much obliged, but I never snack,' the stranger replied and poured seconds. The saucepan was opened and found to contain frankfurters in tomato sauce. And then the accursed green haze before his eyes dissolved, the words began to come out clearly, and, above all, Styopa remembered a thing or two.",test,2,1,0,short service neat efficient stranger allow amazement develop morbid degree deftly poured half glass vodka squeaked pleasure hand twitching brought glass lips stranger swallowed contents glass one gulp lump caviar squeezed words bite something obliged never snack stranger replied poured seconds saucepan opened found contain frankfurters tomato sauce accursed green haze eyes dissolved words began come clearly remembered thing two
5724,"Namely, that it had taken place yesterday in Skhodnya, at the dacha of the sketch-writer Khustov, to which this same Khustov had taken Styopa in a taxi. There was even a memory of having hired this taxi by the Metropol, and there was also some actor, or not an actor... with a gramophone in a little suitcase. Yes, yes, yes, it was at the dacha! The dogs, he remembered, had howled from this gramophone. Only the lady Styopa had wanted to kiss remained unexplained... devil knows who she was... maybe she was in radio, maybe not...  The previous day was thus coming gradually into focus, but right now Styopa was much more interested in today's day and, particularly, in the appearance in his bedroom of a stranger, and with hors d'oeuvres and vodka to boot. It would be nice to explain that! 'Well, I hope by now you've remembered my name? '  But Styopa only smiled bashfully and spread his arms. 'Really!

5725,"Good heavens, it simply isn't done! '  'I beg you to keep it between us,' Styopa said fawningly. 'Oh, of course, of course! But as for Khustov, needless to say, I can't vouch for him. '  'So you know Khustov? '  ""Yesterday, in your office, I saw this individuum briefly, but it only takes a fleeting glance at his face to understand that he is a bastard, a squabbler, a trimmer and a toady. '  `Perfectly true! ' thought Styopa, struck by such a true, precise and succinct definition of Khustov. Yes, the previous day was piecing itself together, but, even so, anxiety would not take leave of the director of the Variety.

5726,"Say what you will, Styopa simply had not seen this stranger in the beret in his office yesterday. 'Professor of black magic Woland,'[3] the visitor said weightily, seeing Styopa's difficulty, and he recounted everything in order. Yesterday afternoon he arrived in Moscow from abroad, went immediately to Styopa, and offered his show to the Variety. Styopa telephoned the Moscow Regional Entertainment Commission and had the question approved (Styopa turned pale and blinked),then signed a contract with Professor Woland for seven performances (Styopa opened his mouth),and arranged that Woland should come the next morning at ten o'clock to work out the details... And so Woland came. Having come, he was met by the housekeeper Grunya, who explained that she had just come herself, that she was not a live-in maid, that Berlioz was not home, and that if the visitor wished to see Stepan Bogdanovich, he should go to his bedroom himself. Stepan Bogdanovich was such a sound sleeper that she would not undertake to wake him up. Seeing what condition Stepan Bogdanovich was in, the artiste sent Grunya to the nearest grocery store for vodka and hors d'oeuvres, to the druggist's for ice, and...  `Allow me to reimburse you,' the mortified Styopa squealed and began hunting for his wallet. 'Oh, what nonsense! ' the guest performer exclaimed and would hear no more of it. And so, the vodka and hors d'oeuvres got explained, but all the same Styopa was a pity to see: he remembered decidedly nothing about the contract and, on his life, had not seen this Woland yesterday.",test,2,3,0,simply seen stranger beret office yesterday black magic visitor said weightily seeing difficulty recounted everything order afternoon arrived abroad went immediately offered show telephoned question approved turned pale blinkedthen signed contract seven performances opened mouthand arranged come next morning ten oclock work details came come met housekeeper explained come livein maid home visitor wished see go bedroom sound sleeper would undertake wake condition artiste sent nearest grocery store vodka hors doeuvres druggists ice reimburse mortified squealed began hunting wallet nonsense guest performer exclaimed would hear vodka hors doeuvres got explained pity see remembered decidedly nothing contract life seen yesterday
5727,"Yes, Khustov had been there, but not Woland. 'May I have a look at the contract? ' Styopa asked quietly. 'Please do, please do...'  Styopa looked at the paper and froze. Everything was in place: first of all, Styopa's own dashing signature... aslant the margin a note in the hand of the findirector [4] Rimsky authorizing the payment of ten thousand roubles to the artiste Woland, as an advance on the thirty-five thousand roubles due him for seven performances. What's more, Woland's signature was right there attesting to his receipt of the ten thousand! `What is all this? ! ' the wretched Styopa thought, his head spinning.

5728,"Well, it went without saying, once the contract had been produced, any further expressions of surprise would simply be indecent. Styopa asked his visitor's leave to absent himself for a moment and, just as he was, in his stocking feet, ran to the front hall for the telephone. On his way he called out in the direction of the kitchen:  'Grunya! '  But no one responded. He glanced at the door to Berlioz's study, which was next to the front hall, and here he was, as they say, flabbergasted. On the door-handle he made out an enormous wax seal [5] on a string. 'Hel-lo! ' someone barked in Styopa's head. 'Just what we needed! '  And here Styopa's thoughts began running on twin tracks, but, as always happens in times of catastrophe, in the same direction and, generally, devil knows where.",test,2,1,0,went without saying contract produced expressions surprise would simply indecent asked visitors leave absent moment stocking feet ran front hall telephone way called direction kitchen one responded glanced door study next front hall say flabbergasted doorhandle made enormous wax seal string someone barked head needed thoughts began running twin tracks always happens times catastrophe direction generally devil knows
5729,"It is even difficult to convey the porridge in Styopa's head. Here was this devilry with the black beret, the chilled vodka, and the incredible contract... And along with all that, if you please, a seal on the door as well! That is, tell anyone you like that Berlioz has been up to no good - no one will believe it, by Jove, no one will believe it! Yet look, there's the seal! Yes, sir...  And here some most disagreeable little thoughts began stirring in Styopa's brain, about the article which, as luck would have it, he had recently inflicted on Mikhail Alexandrovich for publication in his journal. The article, just between us, was idiotic! And worthless. And the money was so little...  Immediately after the recollection of the article, there came flying a recollection of some dubious conversation that had taken place, he recalled, on the twenty-fourth of April, in the evening, right there in the dining room, while Styopa was having dinner with Mikhail Alexandrovich. That is, of course, this conversation could not have been called dubious in the full sense of the word (Styopa would not have ventured upon such a conversation),but it was on some unnecessary subject.

5730,"Before the seal, this conversation would undoubtedly have been considered a perfect trifle, but now, after the seal...  'Ah, Berlioz, Berlioz! ' boiled up in Styopa's head. This is simply too much for one head! '  But it would not do to grieve too long, and Styopa dialled the number of the office of the Variety's findirector, Rimsky. Styopa's position was ticklish: first, the foreigner might get offended that Styopa was checking on him after the contract had been shown, and then to talk with the findirector was also exceedingly difficult. Indeed, he could not just ask him like that:  `Tell me, did I sign a contract for thirty-five thousand roubles yesterday with a professor of black magic? '  It was no good asking like that! 'Yes!

5732,"However, to go on lingering in the front hall was awkward, and Styopa formed a plan straight away: by all means to conceal his incredible forgetfulness, and now, first off, contrive to get out of the foreigner what, in fact, he intended to show that evening in the Variety, of which Styopa was in charge. Here Styopa turned away from the telephone and saw distinctly in the mirror that stood in the front hall, and which the lazy Grunya had not wiped for ages, a certain strange specimen, long as a pole, and in a pince-nez (ah, if only Ivan Nikolaevich had been there! He would have recognized this specimen at once! ). The figure was reflected and then disappeared. Styopa looked further down the hall in alarm and was rocked a second time, for in the mirror a stalwart black cat passed and also disappeared. Styopa's heart skipped a beat, he staggered.

'Am I losing my mind?",test,2,2,0,go lingering front hall awkward formed plan straight away means conceal incredible forgetfulness first contrive get foreigner fact intended show evening charge turned away telephone saw distinctly mirror stood front hall lazy wiped ages certain strange specimen long pole pincenez would recognized specimen figure reflected disappeared looked hall alarm rocked second time mirror stalwart black cat passed also disappeared heart skipped beat staggered thought losing mind
5733,"Where are these reflections coming from? ! ' He peeked into the front hall and cried timorously:  'Grunya! What's this cat doing hanging around here? ! Where did he come from?

5734,"Don't be nervous. And Grunya is not here, I sent her off to Voronezh. She complained you diddled her out of a vacation. '  These words were so unexpected and preposterous that Styopa decided he had not heard right. Utterly bewildered, he trotted back to the bedroom and froze on the threshold. His hair stood on end and small beads of sweat broke out on his brow. The visitor was no longer alone in the bedroom, but had company: in the second armchair sat the same type he had imagined in the front hall. Now he was clearly visible: the feathery moustache, one lens of the pince-nez gleaming, the other not there. But worse things were to be found in the bedroom: on the jeweller's wife's ottoman, in a casual pose, sprawled a third party - namely, a black cat of uncanny size, with a glass of vodka in one paw and a fork, on which he had managed to spear a pickled mushroom, in the other. The light, faint in the bedroom anyway, now began to grow quite dark in Styopa's eyes.",test,2,2,0,nervous sent complained diddled vacation words unexpected preposterous decided heard right bewildered trotted back bedroom froze threshold hair stood end small beads sweat broke brow visitor longer alone bedroom company second armchair sat type imagined front hall clearly visible feathery moustache one lens pincenez gleaming worse things found bedroom jewellers wifes ottoman casual pose sprawled third party namely black cat uncanny size glass vodka one paw fork managed spear pickled mushroom light faint bedroom anyway began grow quite dark eyes
5735,"This is apparently how one loses one's mind...' he thought and caught hold of the doorpost. `I see you're somewhat surprised, my dearest Stepan Bogdanovich? ' Woland inquired of the teeth-chattering Styopa. `And yet there's nothing to be surprised at. This is my retinue. '  Here the cat tossed off the vodka, and Styopa's hand began to slide down the doorpost. 'And this retinue requires room,' Woland continued, 'so there's just one too many of us in the apartment. And it seems to us that this one too many is precisely you. '  Theirself, theirself!

Pulling the wool over their superiors' eyes. '  `Availing hisself of a government car! ' the cat snitched, chewing a mushroom. And here occurred the fourth and last appearance in the apartment, as Styopa, having slid all the way to the floor, clawed at the doorpost with an enfeebled hand. Straight from the pier-glass stepped a short but extraordinarily broad-shouldered man, with a bowler hat on his head and a fang sticking out of his mouth, which made still uglier a physiognomy unprecedentedly loathsome without that. And with flaming red hair besides. 'Generally,' this new one entered into the conversation, `I don't understand how he got to be a director,' the redhead's nasal twang was growing stronger and stronger, 'he's as much a director as I'm a bishop.

5737,"That's what I mean,' twanged the redhead and, turning to Woland, he added deferentially: 'Allow me, Messire, to chuck him the devil out of Moscow? '  'Scat! ' the cat barked suddenly, bristling his fur. And then the bedroom started spinning around Styopa, he hit his head against the doorpost, and, losing consciousness, thought:  'I'm dying...'  But he did not die. Opening his eyes slightly, he saw himself sitting on something made of stone. Around him something was making noise. When he opened his eyes properly, he realized that the noise was being made by the sea and, what's more, that the waves were rocking just at his feet, that he was, in short, sitting at the very end of a jetty, that over him was a brilliant blue sky and behind him a white city on the mountains. Not knowing how to behave in such a case, Styopa got up on his trembling legs and walked along the jetty towards the shore. Some man was standing on the jetty, smoking and spitting into the sea. He looked at Styopa with wild eyes and stopped spitting.",test,2,2,0,mean twanged redhead turning added deferentially chuck devil cat barked suddenly bristling fur bedroom started spinning around hit head doorpost losing consciousness thought dying die eyes slightly saw sitting something made stone something making noise opened eyes properly realized noise made sea whats waves rocking feet short sitting end jetty brilliant blue sky behind white city mountains knowing behave case got trembling legs walked along jetty towards shore man standing jetty smoking spitting sea looked wild eyes stopped spitting
5738,"Then Styopa pulled the following stunt: he knelt down before the unknown smoker and said:  'I implore you, tell me what city is this? '  ""Really! ' said the heartless smoker. 'I'm not drunk,' Styopa replied hoarsely, 'something's happened to me... I'm ill... Where am I? What city is this? '  ""Well, it's Yalta...'  Styopa quietly gasped and sank down on his side, his head striking the warm stone of the jetty. Consciousness left him. CHAPTER 8  The Combat between the Professor and the Poet  At the same time that consciousness left Styopa in Yalta, that is, around half past eleven in the morning, it returned to Ivan Nikolaevich Homeless, who woke up after a long and deep sleep. He spent some time pondering how it was that he had wound up in an unfamiliar room with white walls, with an astonishing night table made of some light metal, and with white blinds behind which one could sense the sun.

5739,"This thought drew after it the remembrance of Berlioz's death, but today it did not provoke a strong shock in Ivan. Having had a good sleep, Ivan Nikolaevich became calmer and began to think more clearly. After lying motionless for some time in this most clean, soft and comfortable spring bed, Ivan noticed a bell button beside him. From a habit of touching things needlessly, Ivan pressed it. He expected the pressing of the button to be followed by some ringing or appearance, but something entirely different happened. A frosted glass cylinder with the word 'Drink' on it lit up at the foot of Ivan's bed. After pausing for a while, the cylinder began to rotate until the word `Nurse' popped out. It goes without saying that the clever cylinder amazed Ivan. The word  'Nurse' was replaced by the words  'Call the Doctor.

5740,"But here he happened to be lucky. Ivan pressed the button a second time at the word  'Attendant'. The cylinder rang quietly in response, stopped, the light went out, and a plump, sympathetic woman in a clean white coat came into the room and said to Ivan:  'Good morning! '  Ivan did not reply, considering such a greeting inappropriate under the circumstances. Indeed, they lock up a healthy man in a clinic, and pretend that that is how it ought to be! The woman meanwhile, without losing her good-natured expression, brought the blinds up with one push of a button, and sun flooded the room through a light and wide-meshed grille which reached right to the floor. Beyond the grille a balcony came into view, beyond that the bank of a meandering river, and on its other bank a cheerful pine wood. 'Time for our bath,' the woman invited, and under her hands the inner wall parted, revealing behind it a bathroom and splendidly equipped toilet. Ivan, though he had resolved not to talk to the woman, could not help himself and, on seeing the water gush into the tub in a wide stream from the gleaming faucet, said ironically:  'Looky there!

We have foreign tourists every day. '  At the words 'foreign tourists', Ivan at once remembered yesterday's consultant. Ivan darkened, looked sullen, and said:  `Foreign tourists... How you all adore foreign tourists! But among them, incidentally, you come across all sorts. I, for instance, met one yesterday - quite something! '  And he almost started telling about Pontius Pilate, but restrained himself, realizing that the woman had no use for these stories, that in any case she could not help him.

5742,"And not only that: opening the door of a cupboard, the woman pointed inside and asked:  'What would you like to put on - a dressing gown or some nice pyjamas? '  Attached to his new dwelling by force, Ivan almost clasped his hands at the woman's casualness and silently pointed his finger at the crimson flannel pyjamas. After this, Ivan Nikolaevich was led down the empty and noiseless corridor and brought to an examining room of huge dimensions. Ivan, having decided to take an ironic attitude towards everything to be found in this wondrously equipped building, at once mentally christened this room the 'industrial kitchen'. And with good reason. Here stood cabinets and glass cases with gleaming nickel-plated instruments. There were chairs of extraordinarily complex construction, some pot-bellied lamps with shiny shades, a myriad of phials, Bunsen burners, electric cords and appliances quite unknown to anyone. In the examining room Ivan was taken over by three persons - two women and a man - all in white. First, they led Ivan to a corner, to a little table, with the obvious purpose of getting something or other out of him.

5743,"Three ways stood before him. The first was extremely tempting: to hurl himself at all these lamps and sophisticated little things, make the devil's own wreck of them, and thereby express his protest at being detained for nothing. But today's Ivan already differed significantly from the Ivan of yesterday, and this first way appeared dubious to him: for all he knew, the thought might get rooted in them that he was a violent madman. Therefore Ivan rejected the first way. There was a second: immediately to begin his account of the consultant and Pontius Pilate. However, yesterday's experience showed that this story either was not believed or was taken somehow perversely. Therefore Ivan renounced this second way as well, deciding to choose the third way - withdrawal into proud silence. He did not succeed in realizing it fully, and had willy-nilly to answer, though charily and glumly, a whole series of questions. Thus they got out of Ivan decidedly everything about his past life, down to when and how he had fallen ill with scarlet fever fifteen years ago. A whole page having been covered with writing about Ivan, it was turned over, and the woman in white went on to questions about Ivan's relatives.",test,2,2,0,ways stood first extremely tempting hurl lamps sophisticated little things make devils wreck thereby express protest detained nothing todays already differed significantly yesterday first way appeared dubious knew thought might get rooted violent madman rejected first way second immediately begin account consultant yesterdays experience showed story either believed taken somehow perversely renounced second way well deciding choose third way withdrawal proud silence succeed realizing fully willynilly answer though charily glumly whole series questions got decidedly everything past life fallen ill scarlet fever fifteen years ago whole page covered writing turned woman white went questions relatives
5744,"Some sort of humdrum started: who died when and why, and whether he drank or had venereal disease, and more of the same. In conclusion he was asked to tell about yesterday's events at the Patriarch's Ponds, but they did not pester him too much, and were not surprised at the information about Pontius Pilate. Here the woman yielded Ivan up to the man, who went to work on him differently and no longer asked any questions. He took the temperature of Ivan's body, counted his pulse, looked in Ivan's eyes, directing some sort of lamp into them. Then the second woman came to the man's assistance, and they pricked Ivan in the back with something, but not painfully, drew some signs on the skin of his chest with the handle of a little hammer, tapped his knees with the hammer, which made Ivan's legs jump, pricked his finger and took his blood, pricked him inside his bent elbow, put some rubber bracelets on his arms...  Ivan just smiled bitterly to himself and reflected on how stupidly and strangely it had all happened. Just think! He had wanted to warn them all of the danger threatening from the unknown consultant, had intended to catch him, and all he had achieved was to wind up in some mysterious room, telling all sorts of hogwash about Uncle Fyodor, who had done some hard drinking in Vologda. Insufferably stupid! Finally Ivan was released.

5745,"Having eaten and drunk all that was offered him, Ivan decided to wait for whoever was chief of this institution, and from this chief to obtain both attention for himself and justice. And he did come, and very soon after Ivan's breakfast. Unexpectedly, the door of Ivan's room opened, and in came a lot of people in white coats. At their head walked a man of about forty-five, as carefully shaven as an actor, with pleasant but quite piercing eyes and courteous manners. The whole retinue showed him tokens of attention and respect, and his entrance therefore came out very solemn. 'Like Pontius Pilate! ' thought Ivan. Yes, this was unquestionably the chief. He sat down on a stool, while everyone else remained standing.

5746,"'Here, Alexander Nikolaevich,' someone with a trim beard said in a low voice, and handed the chief Ivan's chart, all covered with writing. They've sewn up a whole case! ' Ivan thought. And the chief ran through the chart with a practised eye, muttered  'Mm-hm, mm-hm...', and exchanged a few phrases with those around him in a little-known language. 'And he speaks Latin like Pilate,' Ivan thought sadly. Here one word made him jump; it was the word 'schizophrenia' - alas, already uttered yesterday by the cursed foreigner at the Patriarch's Ponds, and now repeated today by Professor Stravinsky. 'And he knew that, too! ' Ivan thought anxiously. The chief apparently made it a rule to agree with and rejoice over everything said to him by those around him, and to express this with the words  'Very nice, very nice...'  'Very nice!

5747,"'  `A poet,' Ivan replied glumly, and for the first time suddenly felt some inexplicable loathing for poetry, and his own verses, coming to mind at once, seemed to him for some reason distasteful. Wrinkling his face, he asked Stravinsky in turn:  'You are a professor? '  To this, Stravinsky, with obliging courtesy, inclined his head. 'And you're the chief here? ' Ivan continued. Stravinsky nodded to this as well. 'I must speak with you,' Ivan Nikolaevich said meaningly. That is what I'm here for,' returned Stravinsky. 'The thing is,' Ivan began, feeling his hour had come, `that I've been got up as a madman, and nobody wants to listen to me! ...'

' Ivan inquired significantly, hoping to produce a great effect with his words. But the effect did not ensue, and Stravinsky quite simply asked the following question:  'And who is this Annushka? '  This question upset Ivan a little; his face twitched. `Annushka is of absolutely no importance here,' he said nervously. ""Devil knows who she is. Just some fool from Sadovaya.

For instance, you chase after him and it's impossible to catch up with him...  And there's also a little pair with him - good ones, too, but in their own way: some long one in broken glasses and, besides him, a cat of incredible size who rides the tram all by himself.

CHAPTER 9  Koroviev's Stunts  Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy, chairman of the tenants' association' [1] of no. 302-bis on Sadovaya Street in Moscow, where the late Berlioz used to reside, had been having the most terrible troubles, starting from that Wednesday night. At midnight, as we already know, a commission of which Zheldybin formed a part came to the house, summoned Nikanor Ivanovich, told him about the death of Berlioz, and together with him went to apartment no. 50.

5762,"Neither Grunya, the daytime housekeeper, nor the light-minded Stepan Bogdanovich was there at the time. The commission announced to Nikanor Ivanovich that it would take the deceased's manuscripts for sorting out, that his living space, that is, three rooms (the former study, living room and dining room of the jeweller's wife),reverted to the disposal of the tenants' association, and that the belongings were to be kept in the aforementioned living space until the heirs were announced. The news of Berlioz's death spread through the whole house with a sort of supernatural speed, and as of seven o'clock Thursday morning, Bosoy began to receive telephone calls and then personal visits with declarations containing claims to the deceased's living space. In the period of two hours, Nikanor Ivanovich received thirty-two such declarations. They contained pleas, threats, libels, denunciations, promises to do renovations at their own expense, references to unbearable overcrowding and the impossibility of living in the same apartment with bandits. Among others there were a description, staggering in its artistic power, of the theft from apartment no. 51 of some meat dumplings, tucked directly into the pocket of a suit jacket, two vows to end life by suicide and one confession of secret pregnancy. Nikanor Ivanovich was called out to the front hall of his apartment, plucked by the sleeve, whispered to, winked at, promised that he would not be left the loser. This torture went on until noon, when Nikanor Ivanovich simply fled his apartment for the management office by the gate, but when he saw them lying in wait for him there, too, he fled that place as well.

His patience exhausted, Nikanor Ivanovich took from his pocket a bunch of duplicate keys belonging to the house management, opened the door with a sovereign hand, and went in. 'Hey, housekeeper!

At the deceased's desk sat an unknown, skinny, long citizen in a little checkered jacket, a jockey's cap, and a pince-nez... well, in short, that same one. 'And who might you be, citizen?

Utterly infuriated, Nikanor Ivanovich rejected the seat and screamed:  'But who are you? '  'I, if you please, serve as interpreter for a foreign individual who has taken up residence in this apartment,' the man calling himself Koroviev introduced himself and clicked the heels of his scuffed, unpolished shoes. Nikanor Ivanovich opened his mouth. The presence of some foreigner in this apartment, with an interpreter to boot, came as a complete surprise to him, and he demanded explanations. The interpreter explained willingly. A foreign artiste, Mr Woland, had been kindly invited by the director of the Variety, Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev, to spend the time of his performances, a week or so, in his apartment, about which he had written to Nikanor Ivanovich yesterday, requesting that he register the foreigner as a temporary resident, while Likhodeev himself took a trip to Yalta.

'The cat I can show you, if you like,' Koroviev offered. This Nikanor Ivanovich refused in his turn, and the interpreter straight away made the chairman an unexpected but quite interesting proposal: seeing that Mr Woland had no desire whatsoever to live in a hotel, and was accustomed to having a lot of space, why shouldn't the tenants' association rent to him, Woland, for one little week, the time of his performances in Moscow, the whole of the apartment, that is, the deceased's rooms as well?

'Believe me, they wring the soul right out of you! They come and either spy on you like the lowest son of a bitch, or else torment you with their caprices - this isn't right and that isn't right! ...

5771,"' Koroviev looked around and then whispered into the chairman's ear: 'A millionaire! '  The interpreter's offer made clear practical sense, it was a very solid offer, yet there was something remarkably unsolid in his manner of speaking, and in his clothes, and in that loathsome, good-for-nothing pince-nez. As a result, something vague weighed on the chairman's soul, but he nevertheless decided to accept the offer. The thing was that the tenants' association, alas, had quite a sizeable deficit. Fuel had to be bought for the heating system by fall, but who was going to shell out for it - no one knew. But with the foreign tourist's money, it might be possible to wriggle out of it. However, the practical and prudent Nikanor Ivanovich said he would first have to settle the question with the foreign tourist bureau. `I understand!

And don't be shy about the money,' he added in a whisper, drawing the chairman to the telephone in the front hall, 'if he won't pay, who will! You should see the villa he's got in Nice! Next summer, when you go abroad, come especially to see it - you'll gasp! '  The business with the foreign tourist bureau was arranged over the phone with an extraordinary speed, quite amazing to the chairman. It turned out that they already knew about Mr Woland's intention of staying in Likhodeev's private apartment and had no objections to it. `That's wonderful! ' Koroviev yelled.

Winking thievishly in the direction of the bedroom, from which the soft leaps of a heavy cat could be heard, he rasped out:  'So it comes to three thousand five hundred for the week? '  To which Nikanor Ivanovich thought he was going to add:  'Some appetite you've got, Nikanor Ivanovich! ' but Koroviev said something quite different:  'What kind of money is that? Ask five, he'll pay it. '  Grinning perplexedly, Nikanor Ivanovich, without noticing how, found himself at the deceased's writing desk, where Koroviev with great speed and dexterity drew up a contract in two copies. Then he flew to the bedroom with them and came back, both copies now bearing the foreigner's sweeping signature. The chairman also signed the contract. Here Koroviev asked for a receipt for five...

The counting-up took place, interspersed with Koroviev's quips and quiddities, such as 'Cash loves counting', 'Your own eye won't lie', and others of the same sort. After counting the money, the chairman received from Koroviev the foreigner's passport for temporary registration, put it, together with the contract and the money, into his briefcase, and, somehow unable to help himself, sheepishly asked for a free pass...  'Don't mention it! ' bellowed Koroviev. 'How many tickets do you want, Nikanor Ivanovich - twelve, fifteen? '  The flabbergasted chairman explained that all he needed was a couple of passes, for himself and Pelageya Antonovna, his wife. Koroviev snatched out a notebook at once and dashed off a pass for Nikanor Ivanovich, for two persons in the front row. And with his left hand the interpreter deftly slipped this pass to Nikanor Ivanovich, while with his right he put into the chairman's other hand a thick, crackling wad.

5775,"'It isn't done...' he murmured. 'I won't hear of it,' Koroviev whispered right in his ear. 'With us it's not done, but with foreigners it is. You'll offend him, Nikanor Ivanovich, and that's embarrassing. You've worked hard...'  `It's severely punishable,' the chairman whispered very, very softly and glanced over his shoulder. 'But where are the witnesses? ' Koroviev whispered into his other ear. 'I ask you, where are they? You don't think... ?

5776,"And then the chairman, somehow limp and even broken, found himself on the stairs. A whirlwind of thoughts raged in his head. There was the villa in Nice, and the trained cat, and the thought that there were in fact no witnesses, and that Pelageya Antonovna would be delighted with the pass. They were incoherent thoughts, but generally pleasant. But, all the same, somewhere, some little needle kept pricking the chairman in the very bottom of his soul. This was the needle of anxiety. Besides, right then on the stairs the chairman was seized, as with a stroke, by the thought:  'But how did the interpreter get into the study if the door was sealed? ! And how was it that he, Nikanor Ivanovich, had not asked about it? '  For some time the chairman stood staring like a sheep at the steps of the stairway, but then he decided to spit on it and not torment himself with intricate questions...

Koroviev responded from somewhere, not in a rattling but in a very clear and resounding voice. And at once the accursed interpreter turned up in the front hall, dialled a number there, and for some reason began speaking very tearfully into the receiver:  'Hello! I consider it my duty to inform you that the chairman of our tenants' association at no. 502-bis on Sadovaya, Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy, is speculating in foreign currency.

What happened next in apartment no. 50 is not known, but it is known what happened at Nikanor Ivanovich's. Having locked himself in the privy with the hook, he took from his briefcase the wad foisted on him by the interpreter and satisfied himself that it contained four hundred roubles. Nikanor Ivanovich wrapped this wad in a scrap of newspaper and put it into the ventilation duct. Five minutes later the chairman was sitting at the table in his small dining room. His wife brought pickled herring from the kitchen, neatly sliced and thickly sprinkled with green onion.

Swallowing his spittle, Nikanor Ivanovich growled like a dog:  'Damn them all! Won't allow a man to eat...  Don't let anyone in, I'm not here, not here...  If it's about the apartment, tell them to stop blathering, there'll be a meeting next week. '  His wife ran to the front hall, while Nikanor Ivanovich, using a ladle, drew from the fire-breathing lake - it, the bone, cracked lengthwise. And at that moment two citizens entered the dining room, with Pelageya Antonovna following them, for some reason looking very pale. Seeing the citizens, Nikanor Ivanovich also turned white and stood up. 'Where's the Jakes? ' the first one, in a white side-buttoned shirt, asked with a preoccupied air. Something thudded against the dining table (this was Nikanor Ivanovich dropping the ladle on to the oilcloth).

5780,"And the visitors immediately hastened to the corridor. ^What's the matter? ' Nikanor Ivanovich asked quietly, going after the visitors. `There can't be anything like that in our apartment... And - your papers... begging your pardon...'  The first, without stopping, showed Nikanor Ivanovich a paper, and the second was at the same moment standing on a stool in the privy, his arm in the ventilation duct. Everything went dark in Nikanor Ivanovich's eyes. The newspaper was removed, but in the wad there were not roubles but some unknown money, bluish-greenish, and with the portrait of some old man. However, Nikanor Ivanovich saw it all dimly, there were some sort of spots floating in front of his eyes.

I swear to God, I never laid a finger on it! ' the chairman cried out desperately. He dashed to the chest, pulled a drawer out with a clatter, and from it the briefcase, crying out incoherently:  'Here's the contract... that vermin of an interpreter stuck me with it... Koroviev... in a pince-nez! ...'  He opened the briefcase, glanced into it, put a hand inside, went blue in the face, and dropped the briefcase into the borscht.

'  It is not known what Pelageya Antonovna imagined here, only she clasped her hands and cried:  'Repent, Ivanych! You'll get off lighter. '  His eyes bloodshot, Nikanor Ivanovich raised his fists over his wife's head, croaking:  'Ohh, you damned fool! '  Here he went slack and sank down on a chair, evidently resolved to submit to the inevitable. During this time, Timofei Kondratievich Kvastsov stood on the landing, placing now his ear, now his eye to the keyhole of the door to the chairman's apartment, melting with curiosity. Five minutes later the tenants of the house who were in the courtyard saw the chairman, accompanied by two other persons, proceed directly to the gates of the house.

5783,"And an hour after that an unknown citizen appeared in apartment no. 11, just as Timofei Kondratievich, spluttering with delight, was telling some other tenants how the chairman got pinched, motioned to Timofei Kondratievich with his finger to come from the kitchen to the front hall, said something to him, and together they vanished. CHAPTER 10  News From Yalta  At the same time that disaster struck Nikanor Ivanovich, not far away from no. 502-bis, on the same Sadovaya Street, in the office of the financial director of the Variety Theatre, Rimsky, there sat two men: Rimsky himself, and the administrator of the Variety, Varenukha [1]. '  The big office on the second floor of the theatre had two windows on Sadovaya and one, just behind the back of the findirector, who was sitting at his desk, facing the summer garden of the Variety, where there were refreshment stands, a shooting gallery and an open-air stage. The furnishings of the office, apart from the desk, consisted of a bunch of old posters hanging on the wall, a small table with a carafe of water on it, four armchairs and, in the corner, a stand on which stood a dust-covered scale model of some past review. Well, it goes without saying that, in addition, there was in the office a small, shabby, peeling fireproof safe, to Rimsky's left, next to the desk. Rimsky, now sitting at his desk, had been in bad spirits since morning, while Varenukha, on the contrary, was very animated and somehow especially restlessly active. Yet there was no outlet for his energy.

5785,"The door opened and an usher dragged in a thick stack of freshly printed extra posters; in big red letters on a green background was printed:  Today and Every Day at the Variety Theatre  an Additional Programme  PROFESSOR WOLAND  S�ances of Black Magic and its Full Exposure  Varenukha stepped back from the poster, which he had thrown on to the scale model, admired it, and told the usher to send all the posters out immediately to be pasted up. 'Good... Loud! ' Varenukha observed on the usher's departure. `And I dislike this undertaking extremely,' Rimsky grumbled, glancing spitefully at the poster through his horn-rimmed glasses, 'and generally I'm surprised he's been allowed to present it. '  'No, Grigory Danilovich, don't say so! This is a very subdue step. The salt is all in the exposure.

5786,"Where he dug him up, devil knows! '  It turned out that Varenukha had not seen the magician any more than Rimsky had. Yesterday Styopa had come running ('like crazy', in Rimsky's expression) to the findirector with the already written draft of a contract, ordered it copied straight away and the money handed over to Woland. And this magician had cleared out, and no one had seen him except Styopa himself. Rimsky took out his watch, saw that it read five minutes past two, and flew into a complete rage. Really! Likhodeev had called at around eleven, said he'd come in half an hour, and not only had not come, but had disappeared from his apartment. 'He's holding up my business!

5787,"' Varenukha said as he held his ear to the receiver, from which came low, prolonged and utterly hopeless signals. ""Wouldn't be a bad thing...' Rimsky said barely audibly through his teeth. At that same moment a woman in a uniform jacket, visored cap, black skirt and sneakers came into the office. From a small pouch at her belt the woman took a small white square and a notebook and asked:  ""Who here is Variety? A super-lightning telegram. [2] Sign here. '  Varenukha scribbled some flourish in the woman's notebook, and as soon as the door slammed behind her, he opened the square. After reading the telegram, he blinked and handed the square to Rimsky. The telegram contained the following: `Yalta to Moscow Variety. Today eleven thirty brown-haired man came criminal investigation nightshirt trousers shoeless mental case gave name Likhodeev Director Variety Wire Yalta criminal investigation where Director Likhodeev.",test,2,2,0,said held ear receiver came low prolonged utterly hopeless signals bad thing said barely audibly teeth moment woman uniform jacket visored cap black skirt sneakers came office small pouch belt woman took small white square notebook asked superlightning telegram scribbled flourish womans notebook soon door slammed behind opened square reading telegram blinked handed square telegram contained following eleven thirty brownhaired man came criminal investigation nightshirt trousers shoeless mental case gave name criminal investigation

5789,"'  Irrespective of the news about the Yalta impostor, Varenukha again began searching all over for Styopa by telephone, and naturally did not find him anywhere. Just as Varenukha, receiver in hand, was pondering where else he might call, the same woman who had brought the first telegram came in and handed Varenukha a new envelope. Opening it hurriedly, Varenukha read the message and whistled. 'What now? ' Rimsky asked, twitching nervously. Varenukha silently handed him the telegram, and the findirector saw there the words: `Beg believe thrown Yalta Woland hypnosis wire criminal investigation confirm identity Likhodeev. '  Rimsky and Varenukha, their heads touching, reread the telegram, and after rereading it, silently stared at each other. 'Citizens! ' the woman got angry.

5790,"I deliver lightnings! '  Varenukha, without taking his eyes off the telegram, made a crooked scrawl in the notebook, and the woman vanished. 'Didn't you talk with him on the phone at a little past eleven? ' the administrator began in total bewilderment. 'No, it's ridiculous! ' Rimsky cried shrilly. Talk or not, he can't be in Yalta now!

5791,"' asked Rimsky, and again the two stared at each other. That some impostor or madman had sent telegrams from Yalta, there was no doubt. But the strange thing was this: how did the Yalta mystifier know Woland, who had come to Moscow just the day before? How did he know about the connection between Likhodeev and Woland? 'Hypnosis...' Varenukha kept repeating the word from the telegram. 'How does he know about Woland? ' He blinked his eyes and suddenly cried resolutely: 'Ah, no! Nonsense! ... Nonsense, nonsense!

5792,"' asked Rimsky. Varenukha immediately got connected with the foreign tourist bureau and, to Rimsky's utter astonishment, announced that Woland was staying in Likhodeev's apartment. Dialling the number of the Likhodeev apartment after that, Varenukha listened for a long time to the low buzzing in the receiver. Amidst the buzzing, from somewhere far away, came a heavy, gloomy voice singing: '... rocks, my refuge ...'[4] and Varenukha decided that the telephone lines had crossed with a voice from a radio show. The apartment doesn't answer,' Varenukha said, putting down the receiver, 'or maybe I should call...'  He did not finish. The same woman appeared in the door, and both men, Rimsky and Varenukha, rose to meet her, while she took from her pouch not a white sheet this time, but some sort of dark one. This is beginning to get interesting,' Varenukha said through his teeth, his eyes following the hurriedly departing woman. Rimsky was the first to take hold of the sheet. On a dark background of photographic paper, some black handwritten lines were barely discernible:  'Proof my handwriting my signature wire urgently confirmation place secret watch Woland Likhodeev. '  In his twenty years of work in the theatre, Varenukha had seen all kinds of sights, but here he felt his mind becoming obscured as with a veil, and he could find nothing to say but the at once mundane and utterly absurd phrase:  This cannot be!",test,2,3,0,asked immediately got connected foreign tourist bureau utter astonishment announced staying apartment number apartment listened long time low buzzing receiver buzzing somewhere far away came heavy gloomy voice singing rocks refuge decided telephone lines crossed voice radio show apartment doesnt answer said putting receiver maybe call finish woman appeared door men rose meet took pouch white sheet time sort dark one beginning get interesting said teeth eyes following hurriedly departing woman first take hold sheet dark background photographic paper black handwritten lines barely discernible handwriting signature wire urgently confirmation place secret watch twenty years work theatre seen kinds sights felt mind becoming obscured veil could find nothing say mundane utterly absurd phrase
5793,"'  Rimsky acted otherwise. He stood up, opened the door, barked out to the messenger girl sitting on a stool:  'Let no one in except postmen! ' - and locked the door with a key. Then he took a pile of papers out of the desk and began carefully to compare the bold, back-slanting letters of the photogram with the letters in Styopa's resolutions and signatures, furnished with a corkscrew flourish. Varenukha, leaning his weight on the table, breathed hotly on Rimsky's cheek. `It's his handwriting,' the findirector finally said firmly, and Varenukha repeated like an echo:  'His. '  Peering into Rimsky's face, the administrator marvelled at the change that had come over this face. Thin to begin with, the findirector seemed to have grown still thinner and even older, his eyes in their horn rims had lost their customary prickliness, and there appeared in them not only alarm, but even sorrow. Varenukha did everything that a man in a moment of great astonishment ought to do. He raced up and down the office, he raised his arms twice like one crucified, he drank a whole glass of yellowish water from the carafe and exclaimed:  'I don't understand!",test,2,2,0,acted otherwise stood opened door barked messenger girl sitting stool one except postmen locked door key took pile papers desk began carefully compare bold backslanting letters photogram letters resolutions signatures furnished corkscrew flourish leaning weight table breathed hotly cheek handwriting findirector finally said firmly repeated like echo face administrator marvelled change come face begin findirector seemed grown still thinner even older eyes horn rims lost customary prickliness appeared alarm even sorrow everything man moment great astonishment ought raced office raised arms twice like one crucified drank whole glass yellowish water carafe exclaimed dont understand
5794,"I don't understand! I don't un-der-stand! '  Rimsky meanwhile was looking out the window, thinking hard about something. The findirector's position was very difficult. It was necessary at once, right on the spot, to invent ordinary explanations for extraordinary phenomena. Narrowing his eyes, the findirector pictured to himself Styopa, in a nightshirt and shoeless, getting into some unprecedented super-high-speed airplane at around half past eleven that morning, and then the same Styopa, also at half past eleven, standing in his stocking feet at the airport in Yalta ... devil knew what to make of it! Maybe it was not Styopa who talked with him this morning over the phone from his own apartment? No, it was Styopa speaking! Who if not he should know Styopa's voice?

5795,"How could he have gone or flown away without leaving word at the theatre? But if he had flown away yesterday evening - he would not have arrived by noon today. Or would he? 'How many miles is it to Yalta? ' asked Rimsky. Varenukha stopped his running and yelled:  'I thought of that! I already thought of it! By train it's over nine hundred miles to Sebastopol, plus another fifty to Yalta! Well, but by air, of course, it's less. '  Hm ... Yes ...

5796,"But what then? Some fighter plane? Who would let Styopa on any fighter plane without his shoes? What for? Maybe he took his shoes off when he got to Yalta? It's the same thing: what for? And even with his shoes on they wouldn't have let him on a fighter! And what has the fighter got to do with it?

5797,"It had been twenty minutes past eleven! So what does it boil down to? If one supposes that after the conversation Styopa instantly rushed to the airport, and reached it in, say, five minutes (which, incidentally, was also unthinkable),it means that the plane, taking off at once, covered nearly a thousand miles in five minutes. Consequently, it was flying at twelve thousand miles an hour! ! ! That cannot be, and that means he's not in Yalta! What remains, then? Hypnosis?

The findirector's face was literally dreadful. The door handle was all the while being turned and pulled from outside, and the messenger girl could be heard through the door crying desperately:  'Impossible! I won't let you! Cut me to pieces! It's a meeting!

5799,"'  'Clever! ' Varenukha observed mentally. But the conversation with Yalta did not take place. Rimsky hung up the receiver and said:  'As luck would have it, the line's broken.

Varenukha ran out, slammed the door behind him, and rushed through the side entrance into the summer garden. The administrator was agitated and full of energy. After the insolent phone call he had no doubts that it was a band of hooligans playing nasty tricks, and that these tricks were connected with the disappearance of Likhodeev.

5810,"It happens that way when a man strives to become the centre of attention, to bring sensational news somewhere. In the garden the wind blew in the administrator's face and flung sand in his eyes, as if blocking his way, as if cautioning him. A window on the second floor slammed so that the glass nearly broke, the tops of the maples and lindens rustled alarmingly. It became darker and colder. The administrator rubbed his eyes and saw that a yellow-bellied storm cloud was creeping low over Moscow. There came a dense, distant rumbling. However great Varenukha's hurry, an irrepressible desire pulled at him to run over to the summer toilet for a second on his way, to check whether the repairman had put a wire screen over the light-bulb. Running past the shooting gallery, Varenukha came to a thick growth of lilacs where the light-blue toilet building stood. The repairman turned out to be an efficient fellow, the bulb under the roof of the gentlemen's side was covered with a wire screen, but the administrator was upset that even in the pre-storm darkness one could make out that the walls were already written all over in charcoal and pencil.

'Very, very glad,' the cat-like fat man responded in a squeaky voice and, suddenly swinging his arm, gave Varenukha such a blow on the ear that the cap flew off the administrator's head and vanished without a trace down the hole in the seat. At the fat man's blow, the whole toilet lit up momentarily with a tremulous light, and a roll of thunder echoed in the sky. Then came another flash and a second man emerged before the administrator - short, but with athletic shoulders, hair red as fire, albugo in one eye, a fang in his mouth...  This second one, evidently a lefty, socked the administrator on the other ear. In response there was another roll of thunder in the sky, and rain poured down on the wooden roof of the toilet. `What is it, comr...' the half-crazed administrator whispered, realized at once that the word 'comrades' hardly fitted bandits attacking a man in a public toilet, rasped out: 'citiz...' - figured that they did not merit this appellation either, and received a third terrible blow from he did not know which of them, so that blood gushed from his nose on to his Tolstoy blouse.

And the two picked the administrator up under the arms, dragged him out of the garden, and raced down Sadovaya with him. The storm raged at full force, water streamed with a noise and howling down the drains, waves bubbled and billowed everywhere, water gushed from the roofs past the drainpipes, foamy streams ran from gateways.

Then they dashed into the sixth entrance, and Varenukha, nearly insane, was taken up to the fifth floor and thrown down in the semi-dark front hall, so well known to him, of Styopa Likhodeev's apartment. Here the two robbers vanished, and in their place there appeared in the front hall a completely naked girl - red-haired, her eyes burning with a phosphorescent gleam. Varenukha understood that this was the most terrible of all things that had ever happened to him and, moaning, recoiled against the wall. But the girl came right up to the administrator and placed the palms of her hands on his shoulders. Varenukha's hair stood on end, because even through the cold, water-soaked cloth of his Tolstoy blouse he could feel that those palms were still colder, that their cold was the cold of ice. `Let me give you a kiss,' the girl said tenderly, and there were shining eyes right in front of his eyes. Then Varenukha fainted and never felt the kiss.

5814,"In the sky, threads flashed every moment, the sky kept bursting open, and the patient's room was flooded with a tremulous, frightening light. Ivan quietly wept, sitting on his bed and looking out at the muddy river boiling with bubbles. At every clap of thunder, he cried out pitifully and buried his face in his hands. Pages covered with Ivan's writing lay about on the floor. They had been blown down by the wind that flew into the room before the storm began. The poet's attempts to write a statement concerning the terrible consultant had gone nowhere. As soon as he got the pencil stub and paper from the fat attendant, whose name was Praskovya Fyodorovna, he rubbed his hands in a business-like way and hastily settled himself at the little table.

5815,"A statement. Yesterday evening I came to the Patriarch's Ponds with the deceased M. A. Berlioz...'  And right there the poet got confused, mainly owing to the word 'deceased'. Some nonsensicality emerged at once: what's this - came with the deceased? The deceased don't go anywhere! Really, for all he knew, they might take him for a madman! Having reflected thus, Ivan Nikolaevich began to correct what he had written. What came out this time was: '... with M. A.  Berlioz, subsequently deceased ...'  This did not satisfy the author either. He had to have recourse to a third redaction, which proved still worse than the first two: 'Berlioz, who fell under the tram-car...' - and that namesake composer, unknown to anyone, was also dangling here, so he had to put in: 'not the composer...'  After suffering over these two Berliozes, Ivan crossed it all out and decided to begin right off with something very strong, in order to attract the reader's attention at once, so he wrote that a cat had got on a tram-car, and then went back to the episode with the severed head. The head and the consultant's prediction led him to the thought of Pontius Pilate, and for greater conviction Ivan decided to tell the whole story of the procurator in full, from the moment he walked out in his white cloak with blood-red lining to the colonnade of Herod's palace. Ivan worked assiduously, crossing out what he had written, putting in new words, and even attempted to draw Pontius Pilate and then a cat standing on its hind legs.",test,2,3,0,statement evening came deceased right poet got confused mainly owing word nonsensicality emerged whats came deceased deceased dont go anywhere knew might take madman reflected thus began correct written came time subsequently deceased satisfy author either recourse third redaction proved still worse first two fell tramcar namesake composer unknown anyone also dangling put composer suffering two crossed decided begin right something strong order attract readers attention wrote cat got tramcar went back episode severed head head consultants prediction led thought greater conviction decided tell whole story procurator full moment walked white cloak bloodred lining colonnade palace worked assiduously crossing written putting new words even attempted draw cat standing hind legs
5816,"But the drawings did not help, and the further it went, the more confusing and incomprehensible the poet's statement became. By the time the frightening cloud with smoking edges appeared from far off and covered the woods, and the wind began to blow, Ivan felt that he was strengthless, that he would never be able to manage with the statement, and he would not pick up the scattered pages, and he wept quietly and bitterly. The good-natured nurse Praskovya Fyodorovna visited the poet during the storm, became alarmed on seeing him weeping, closed the blinds so that the lightning would not frighten the patient, picked up the pages from the floor, and ran with them for the doctor. He came, gave Ivan an injection in the arm, and assured him that he would not weep any more, that everything would pass now, everything would change, everything would be forgotten. The doctor proved right. Soon the woods across the river became as before. It was outlined to the last tree under the sky, which cleared to its former perfect blue, and the river grew calm. Anguish had begun to leave Ivan right after the injection, and now the poet lay calmly and looked at the rainbow that stretched across the sky. So it went till evening, and he did not even notice how the rainbow melted away, how the sky saddened and faded, how the woods turned black.

5817,"The accursed, demonic cat somehow softened in his memory, the severed head did not frighten him any more, and, abandoning all thought of it, Ivan began to reflect that, essentially, it was not so bad in the clinic, that Stravinsky was a clever man and a famous one, and it was quite pleasant to deal with him. Besides, the evening air was sweet and fresh after the storm. The house of sorrow was falling asleep. In quiet corridors the frosted white lights went out, and in their place, according to regulations, faint blue night-lights were lit, and the careful steps of attendants were heard more and more rarely on the rubber matting of the corridor outside the door. Now Ivan lay in sweet languor, glancing at the lamp under its shade, shedding a softened light from the ceiling, then at the moon rising behind the black woods, and conversed with himself. 'Why, actually, did I get so excited about Berlioz falling under a tram-car? ' the poet reasoned. `In the final analysis, let him sink! What am I, in fact, his chum or in-law?

And furthermore, citizens,' Ivan continued his speech, addressing someone or other, `let's sort this out: why, tell me, did I get furious at this mysterious consultant, magician and professor with the black and empty eye? Why all this absurd chase after him in underpants and with a candle in my hand, and then those wild shenanigans in the restaurant? '  'Uh-uh-uh!

' a bass voice said distinctly somewhere, a voice not belonging to either of the Ivans and extremely like the bass of the consultant. Ivan, for some reason not offended by the word 'fool', but even pleasantly surprised at it, smiled and drowsily grew quiet. Sleep was stealing over Ivan, and he was already picturing a palm tree on its elephant's leg, and a cat passing by - not scary, but merry - and, in short, sleep was just about to come over Ivan, when the grille suddenly moved noiselessly aside, and a mysterious figure appeared on the balcony, hiding from the moonlight, and shook its finger at Ivan. Not frightened in the least, Ivan sat up in bed and saw that there was a man on the balcony. And this man, pressing a finger to his lips, whispered:  'Shhh! ...'

5821,"To the sounds of a foxtrot he made a circle, and then gave a triumphant shout, which caused his bicycle to rear up. After riding around on the back wheel, the little man turned upside down, contrived while in motion to unscrew the front wheel and send it backstage, and then proceeded on his way with one wheel, turning the pedals with his hands. On a tall metal pole with a seat at the top and a single wheel, a plump blonde rolled out in tights and a little skirt strewn with silver stars, and began riding in a circle. As he met her, the little man uttered cries of greeting, doffing his bowler-hat with his foot. Finally, a little eight-year-old with an elderly face came rolling out and began scooting about among the adults on a tiny two-wheeler furnished with an enormous automobile horn. After making several loops, the whole company, to the alarming drum-beats of the orchestra, rolled to the very edge of the stage, and the spectators in the front rows gasped and drew back, because it seemed to the public that the whole trio with its vehicles was about to crash down into the orchestra pit. But the bicycles stopped just at the moment when the front wheels threatened to slide into the abyss on the heads of the musicians. With a loud shout of  'Hup! ' the cyclists jumped off their vehicles and bowed, the blonde woman blowing kisses to the public, and the little one tooting a funny signal on his horn.

5822,"It was the intermission before the last part. The only man who was not the least bit interested in the wonders of the Giulli family's cycling technique was Grigory Danilovich Rimsky. In complete solitude he sat in his office, biting his thin lips, a spasm passing over his face from time to time. To the extraordinary disappearance of Likhodeev had now been added the wholly unforeseen disappearance of Varenukha. Rimsky knew where he had gone, but he had gone and ... not come back! Rimsky shrugged his shoulders and whispered to himself:  'But what for? '  And it was strange: for such a practical man as the findirector, the simplest thing would, of course, have been to call the place where Varenukha had gone and find out what had befallen him, yet until ten o'clock at night he had been unable to force himself to do it. At ten, doing outright violence to himself, Rimsky picked up the receiver and here discovered that his telephone was dead. The messenger reported that the other telephones in the building were also out of order.

5823,"Just as the red light over the findirector's head lit up and blinked, announcing the beginning of the intermission, a messenger came in and informed him of the foreign artiste's arrival. The findirector cringed for some reason, and, blacker than a storm cloud, went backstage to receive the visitor, since there was no one else to receive him. Under various pretexts, curious people kept peeking into the big dressing room from the corridor, where the signal bell was already ringing. Among them were conjurers in bright robes and turbans, a skater in a white knitted jacket, a storyteller pale with powder and the make-up man. The newly arrived celebrity struck everyone by his marvellously cut tailcoat, of a length never seen before, and by his having come in a black half-mask. But most remarkable of all were the black magician's two companions: a long checkered one with a cracked pince-nez, and a fat black cat who came into the dressing room on his hind legs and quite nonchalantly sat on the sofa squinting at the bare make-up lights. Rimsky attempted to produce a smile on his face, which made it look sour and spiteful, and bowed to the silent black magician, who was seated on the sofa beside the cat. There was no handshake. Instead, the easygoing checkered one made his own introductions to the fin-director, calling himself 'the gent's assistant'. This circumstance surprised the findirector, and unpleasantly so: there was decidedly no mention of any assistant in the contract.",test,2,3,0,red light findirectors head lit blinked announcing beginning intermission messenger came informed foreign artistes arrival findirector cringed reason blacker storm cloud went backstage receive visitor since one else receive various pretexts curious people kept peeking big dressing room corridor signal bell already ringing conjurers bright robes turbans skater white knitted jacket storyteller pale powder makeup man newly arrived celebrity struck everyone marvellously cut tailcoat length never seen come black halfmask remarkable black magicians two companions long checkered one cracked pincenez fat black cat came dressing room hind legs quite nonchalantly sat sofa squinting bare makeup lights attempted produce smile face made look sour spiteful bowed silent black magician seated sofa beside cat handshake easygoing checkered one made introductions findirector calling gents assistant circumstance surprised findirector unpleasantly decidedly mention assistant contract
5824,"Quite stiffly and drily, Grigory Danilovich inquired of this fallen-from-the-sky checkered one where the artiste's paraphernalia was. 'Our heavenly diamond, most precious mister director,' the magician's assistant replied in a rattling voice, 'the paraphernalia is always with us. Here it is! Ein, zwei, drei! ' And, waving his knotty fingers before Rimsky's eyes, he suddenly took from behind the cat's ear Rimsky's own gold watch and chain, hitherto worn by the findirector in his waistcoat pocket, under his buttoned coat, with the chain through a buttonhole.

5825,"Getting up from the sofa unexpectedly, he walked on his hind legs to the dressing table, pulled the stopper out of the carafe with his front paw, poured water into a glass, drank it, installed the stopper in its place, and wiped his whiskers with a make-up cloth. Here no one even gasped, their mouths simply fell open, and the make-up man whispered admiringly:  'That's class! '  Just then the bells rang alarmingly for the third time, and everyone, agitated and anticipating an interesting number, thronged out of the dressing room. A moment later the spheres went out in the theatre, the footlights blazed up, lending a reddish glow to the base of the curtain, and in the lighted gap of the curtain there appeared before the public a plump man, merry as a baby, with a clean-shaven face, in a rumpled tailcoat and none-too-fresh shirt. This was the master of ceremonies, well known to all Moscow - Georges Bengalsky. 'And now, citizens,' Bengalsky began, smiling his baby smile, 'there is about to come before you ...' Here Bengalsky interrupted himself and spoke in a different tone: 'I see the audience has grown for the third part. We've got half the city here! I met a friend the other day and said to him:  ""Why don't you come to our show? Yesterday we had half the city"".

5826,"' Bengalsky paused, waiting for a burst of laughter, but as no one laughed, he went on: '... And so, now comes the famous foreign artiste. Monsieur Woland, with a s�ance of black magic. Well, both you and I know,' here Bengalsky smiled a wise smile, 'that there's no such thing in the world, and that it's all just superstition, and Maestro Woland is simply a perfect master of the technique of conjuring, as we shall see from the most interesting part, that is, the exposure of this technique, and since we're all of us to a man both for technique and for its exposure, let's bring on Mr Woland! ...'  After uttering all this claptrap, Bengalsky pressed his palms together and waved them in greeting through the slit of the curtain, which caused it to part with a soft rustic. The entrance of the magician with his long assistant and the cat, who came on stage on his hind legs, pleased the audience greatly. 'An armchair for me,' Woland ordered in a low voice, and that same second an armchair appeared on stage, no one knew how or from where, in which the magician sat down. 'Tell me, my gentle Fagott,' Woland inquired of the checkered clown, who evidently had another appellation than Koroviev, `what do you think, the Moscow populace has changed significantly, hasn't it? '  The magician looked out at the hushed audience, struck by the appearance of the armchair out of nowhere. ""That it has, Messire,' Fagott-Koroviev replied in a low voice.

5827,"The city folk have changed greatly ... externally, that is ... as has the city itself, incidentally...  Not to mention their clothing, these ... what do you call them ... trams, automobiles ... have appeared ...'  'Buses ...'-Fagott prompted deferentially. The audience listened attentively to this conversation, thinking it constituted a prelude to the magic tricks. The wings were packed with performers and stage-hands, and among their faces could be seen the tense, pale face of Rimsky. The physiognomy of Bengalsky, who had retreated to the side of the stage, began to show some perplexity. He raised one eyebrow slightly and, taking advantage of a pause, spoke:  ""The foreign artiste is expressing his admiration for Moscow and its technological development, as well as for the Muscovites. ' Here Bengalsky smiled twice, first to the stalls, then to the gallery. Woland, Fagott and the cat turned their heads in the direction of the master of ceremonies. 'Did I express admiration? ' the magician asked the checkered Fagott. 'By no means, Messire, you never expressed any admiration,' came the reply.",test,2,2,0,city folk changed greatly externally city incidentally mention clothing call trams automobiles appeared prompted deferentially audience listened attentively conversation thinking constituted prelude magic tricks wings packed performers stagehands among faces could seen tense pale face physiognomy retreated side stage began show perplexity raised one eyebrow slightly taking advantage pause spoke foreign artiste expressing admiration technological development well smiled twice first stalls gallery cat turned heads direction master ceremonies express admiration magician asked checkered means never expressed admiration came reply
5828,"Then what is the man saying? '  'He quite simply lied! ' the checkered assistant declared sonorously, for the whole theatre to hear, and turning to Bengalsky, he added: 'Congrats, citizen, you done lied! '  Tittering spattered from the gallery, but Bengalsky gave a start and goggled his eyes. 'Of course, I'm not so much interested in buses, telephones and other ...'  'Apparatuses,' the checkered one prompted. 'Quite right, thank you,' the magician spoke slowly in a heavy bass, `as in a question of much greater importance: have the city folk changed inwardly? '  ""Yes, that is the most important question, sir. '  There was shrugging and an exchanging of glances in the wings, Bengalsky stood all red, and Rimsky was pale. But here, as if sensing the nascent alarm, the magician said:  'However, we're talking away, my dear Fagott, and the audience is beginning to get bored.

5829,"'  The audience stirred. Fagott and the cat walked along the footlights to opposite sides of the stage. Fagott snapped his fingers, and with a rollicking Three, four! ' snatched a deck of cards from the air, shuffled it, and sent it in a long ribbon to the cat. The cat intercepted it and sent it back. The satiny snake whiffled, Fagott opened his mouth like a nestling and swallowed it all card by card. After which the cat bowed, scraping his right hind paw, winning himself unbelievable applause.

5830,"And Fagott jabbed his finger at the stalls and announced:  'You'll find that same deck, esteemed citizens, on citizen Parchevsky in the seventh row, just between a three-rouble bill and a summons to court in connection with the payment of alimony to citizen Zeikova. '  There was a stirring in the stalls, people began to get up, and finally some citizen whose name was indeed Parchevsky, all crimson with amazement, extracted the deck from his wallet and began sticking it up in the air, not knowing what to do with it. 'You may keep it as a souvenir! ' cried Fagott. 'Not for nothing did you say at dinner yesterday that if it weren't for poker your life in Moscow would be utterly unbearable. '  `An old trick!

It's ten-rouble bills! '  Those sitting in the stalls turned their heads. In the gallery a bewildered citizen found in his pocket a bank-wrapped packet with  'One thousand roubles' written on it. His neighbours hovered over him, and he, in amazement, picked at the wrapper with his fingernail, trying to find out if the bills were real or some sort of magic ones.

They twirled, got blown aside, were drawn towards the gallery, bounced into the orchestra and on to the stage. In a few seconds, the rain of money, ever thickening, reached the seats, and the spectators began snatching at it. Hundreds of arms were raised, the spectators held the bills up to the lighted stage and saw the most true and honest-to-God watermarks. The smell also left no doubts: it was the incomparably delightful smell of freshly printed money. The whole theatre was seized first with merriment and then with amazement.

5834,"' hummed everywhere, there were gasps of 'ah, ah! ' and merry laughter. One or two were already crawling in the aisles, feeling under the chairs. Many stood on the seats, trying to catch the flighty, capricious notes. Bewilderment was gradually coming to the faces of the policemen, and performers unceremoniously began sticking their heads out from the wings. In the dress circle a voice was heard: `What're you grabbing at? It's mine, it flew to me! ' and another voice:  'Don't shove me, or you'll get shoved back!

5835,"The general agitation was increasing, and no one knows where it all would have ended if Fagott had not stopped the rain of money by suddenly blowing into the air. Two young men, exchanging significant and merry glances, took off from their seats and made straight for the buffet. There was a hum in the theatre, all the spectators' eyes glittered excitedly. Yes, yes, no one knows where it all would have ended if Bengalsky had not summoned his strength and acted. Trying to gain better control of himself, he rubbed his hands, as was his custom, and in his most resounding voice spoke thus:  'Here, citizens, you and I have just beheld a case of so-called mass hypnosis. A purely scientific experiment, proving in the best way possible that there are no miracles in magic. Let us ask Maestro Woland to expose this experiment for us. Presently, citizens, you will see these supposed banknotes disappear as suddenly as they appeared. '  Here he applauded, but quite alone, while a confident smile played on his face, yet in his eyes there was no such confidence, but rather an expression of entreaty.

5836,"Total silence fell, which was broken by the checkered Fagott. `And this is a case of so-called lying,' he announced in a loud, goatish tenor. The notes, citizens, are genuine. '  'Bravo! ' a bass barked from somewhere on high. This one, incidentally,' here Fagott pointed to Bengalsky, 'annoys me.

5838,"'  And an unheard-of thing occurred. The fur bristled on the cat's back, and he gave a rending miaow. Then he compressed himself into a ball and shot like a panther straight at Bengalsky's chest, and from there on to his head. Growling, the cat sank his plump paws into the skimpy chevelure of the master of ceremonies and in two twists tore the head from the thick neck with a savage howl. The two and a half thousand people in the theatre cried out as one. Blood spurted in fountains from the torn neck arteries and poured over the shirt-front and tailcoat. The headless body paddled its feet somehow absurdly and sat down on the floor. Hysterical women's cries came from the audience. The cat handed the head to Fagott, who lifted it up by the hair and showed it to the audience, and the head cried desperately for all the theatre to hear:  'A doctor!

5839,"' Fagott asked the weeping head menacingly. 'Never again! ' croaked the head. 'For God's sake, don't torture him! ' a woman's voice from a box seat suddenly rose above the clamour, and the magician turned in the direction of that voice. 'So, what then, citizens, shall we forgive him? ' Fagott asked, addressing the audience. 'Forgive him, forgive him! ' separate voices, mostly women's, spoke first, then merged into one chorus with the men's. 'What are your orders, Messire?",test,2,4,1,asked weeping head menacingly croaked head sake dont torture womans voice box seat suddenly rose clamour magician turned direction voice citizens shall forgive asked addressing audience forgive separate voices mostly womens spoke first merged one chorus mens orders

Mankind loves money, whatever it's made of- leather, paper, bronze, gold. Well, they're light-minded ... well, what of it ... mercy sometimes knocks at their hearts ... ordinary people... In general, reminiscent of the former ones ... only the housing problem has corrupted them...' And he ordered loudly: 'Put the head on. '  The cat, aiming accurately, planted the head on the neck, and it sat exactly in its place, as if it had never gone anywhere. Above all, there was not even any scar left on the neck. The cat brushed Bengalsky's tailcoat and shirt-front with his paws, and all traces of blood disappeared from them. Fagott got the sitting Bengalsky to his feet, stuck a packet of money into his coat pocket, and sent him from the stage with the words:  'Buzz off, it's more fun without you! '  Staggering and looking around senselessly, the master of ceremonies had plodded no farther than the fire post when he felt sick. He cried out pitifully:  'My head, my head! ...'

5841,"The master of ceremonies wept, snatched at something in the air with his hands, and muttered:  'Give me my head, give me back my head ...  Take my apartment, take my paintings, only give me back my head! ...'  A messenger ran for a doctor. They tried to lie Bengalsky down on a sofa in the dressing room, but he began to struggle, became violent. They had to call an ambulance. When the unfortunate master of ceremonies was taken away, Rimsky ran back to the stage and saw that new wonders were taking place on it. Ah, yes, incidentally, either then or a little earlier, the magician disappeared from the stage together with his faded armchair, and it must be said that the public took absolutely no notice of it, carried away as it was by the extraordinary things Fagott was unfolding on stage. And Fagott, having packed off the punished master of ceremonies, addressed the public thus:  `All righty, now that we've kicked that nuisance out, let's open a ladies' shop! '  And all at once the floor of the stage was covered with Persian carpets, huge mirrors appeared, lit by greenish tubes at the sides, and between the mirrors - display windows, and in them the merrily astonished spectators saw Parisian ladies' dresses of various colours and cuts. In some of the windows, that is, while in others there appeared hundreds of ladies' hats, with feathers and without feathers, and - with buckles or without - hundreds of shoes, black, white, yellow, leather, satin, suede, with straps, with stones. Among the shoes there appeared cases of perfume, mountains of handbags of antelope hide, suede, silk, and among these, whole heaps of little elongated cases of gold metal such as usually contain lipstick.",test,2,3,0,master ceremonies wept snatched something air hands muttered head give back head apartment take paintings give back head messenger ran doctor tried lie sofa dressing room began struggle became violent call ambulance unfortunate master ceremonies taken away ran back stage saw new wonders taking place yes incidentally either little earlier magician disappeared stage together faded armchair must said public took absolutely notice carried away extraordinary things unfolding stage packed punished master ceremonies addressed public thus righty weve kicked nuisance lets open ladies shop floor stage covered carpets huge mirrors appeared lit greenish tubes sides mirrors display windows merrily astonished spectators saw ladies dresses various colours cuts windows others appeared hundreds ladies hats feathers without feathers buckles without hundreds shoes black white yellow leather satin suede straps stones shoes appeared cases perfume mountains handbags antelope hide suede silk among whole heaps little elongated cases gold metal usually contain lipstick
5842,"A red-headed girl appeared from devil knows where in a black evening dress - a girl nice in all respects, had she not been marred by a queer scar on her neck - smiling a proprietary smile by the display windows. Fagott, grinning sweetly, announced that the firm was offering perfectly gratis an exchange of the ladies' old dresses and shoes for Parisian models and Parisian shoes. The same held, he added, for the handbags and other things. The cat began scraping with his hind paw, while his front paw performed the gestures appropriate to a doorman opening a door. The girl sang out sweetly, though with some hoarseness, rolling her r's, something not quite comprehensible but, judging by the women's faces in the stalls, very tempting:  'Gueriain, Chanel, Mitsouko, Narcisse Noir, Chanel No. 5, evening gowns, cocktail dresses ...'

5843,"Finally some brunette stood up in the tenth row of the stalls and, smiling as if to say it was all the same to her and she did not give a hoot, went and climbed on stage by the side stairs. 'Bravo! ' Fagott shouted. 'Greetings to the first customer! Behemoth, a chair! Let's start with the shoes, madame. '  The brunette sat in the chair, and Fagott at once poured a whole heap of shoes on the rug in front of her.

The brunette's old shoes were tossed behind a curtain, and she proceeded there herself, accompanied by the red-headed girl and Fagott, who was carrying several fashionable dresses on hangers. The cat bustled about, helped, and for greater importance hung a measuring tape around his neck. A minute later the brunette came from behind the curtain in such a dress that the stalls all let out a gasp. The brave woman, who had become astonishingly prettier, stopped at the mirror, moved her bare shoulders, touched the hair on her nape and, twisting, tried to peek at her back.

5845,"And here there came a clean breakthrough, and from all sides women marched on to the stage. Amid the general agitation of talk, chuckles and gasps, a man's voice was heard:  'I won't allow it! ' and a woman's:  `Despot and philistine! Don't break my arm! '  Women disappeared behind the curtain, leaving their dresses there and coming out in new ones. A whole row of ladies sat on stools with gilded legs, stamping the carpet energetically with newly shod feet. Fagott was on his knees, working away with a metal shoehorn; the cat, fainting under piles of purses and shoes, plodded back and forth between the display windows and the stools; the girl with the disfigured neck appeared and disappeared, and reached the point where she started rattling away entirely in French, and, surprisingly, the women all understood her from half a word, even those who did not know a single word of French. General amazement was aroused by a man edging his way on-stage. He announced that his wife had the flu, and he therefore asked that something be sent to her through him.

5846,"The solicitous husband's announcement was met with guffaws. Fagott shouted that he believed him like his own self, even without the passport, and handed the citizen two pairs of silk stockings, and the cat for his part added a little tube of lipstick. Late-coming women tore on to the stage, and off the stage the lucky ones came pouring down in ball gowns, pyjamas with dragons, sober formal outfits, little hats tipped over one eyebrow. Then Fagott announced that owing to the lateness of the hour, the shop would close in exactly one minute until the next evening, and an unbelievable scramble arose on-stage. Women hastily grabbed shoes without trying them on. One burst behind the curtain like a storm, got out of her dress there, took possession of the first thing that came to hand - a silk dressing-gown covered with huge bouquets - and managed to pick up two cases of perfume besides. Exactly a minute later a pistol shot rang out, the mirrors disappeared, the display windows and stools dropped away, the carpet melted into air, as did the curtain. Last to disappear was the high mountain of old dresses and shoes, and the stage was again severe, empty and bare. And it was here that a new character mixed into the affair.

It is also desirable that the master of ceremonies return to the stage. The spectators are concerned about his fate. '  The baritone belonged to none other than that evening's guest of honour, Arkady Apollonovich Sempleyarov, chairman of the Acoustics Commission of the Moscow theatres. Arkady Apollonovich was in his box with two ladies: the older one dressed expensively and fashionably, the other one, young and pretty, dressed in a simpler way. The first, as was soon discovered during the drawing up of the report, was Arkady Apollonovich's wife, and the second was his distant relation, a promising debutante, who had come from Saratov and was living in the apartment of Arkady Apollonovich and his wife.

5849,"And so, allow me to ask, where were you last evening, Arkady Apollonovich? '  At this inappropriate and perhaps even boorish question, Arkady Apollonovich's countenance changed, and changed quite drastically. `Last evening Arkady Apollonovich was at a meeting of the Acoustics Commission,' Arkady Apollonovich's wife declared very haughtily, ""but I don't understand what that has got to do with magic. '  'Ouee, madame! ' Fagott agreed. 'Naturally you don't understand. As for the meeting, you are totally deluded. After driving off to the said meeting, which incidentally was not even scheduled for last night, Arkady Apollonovich dismissed his chauffeur at the Acoustics Commission building on Clean Ponds' (the whole theatre became hushed),`and went by bus to Yelokhovskaya Street to visit an actress from the regional itinerant theatre, Militsa Andreevna Pokobatko, with whom he spent some four hours.

Now I see why that giftless thing got the role of Louisa [1]! ''  And, swinging suddenly, she struck Arkady Apollonovich on the head with her short and fat violet umbrella.

'He curses Pushkin up and down and keeps shouting:  ""Kurolesov, encore, encore""! ' the guest said, twitching nervously. Having calmed himself, he sat down, said: 'Anyway, God help him,' and continued his conversation with Ivan: 'So, how did you wind up here?

Ivan learned that his guest and his secret wife, from the very first days of their liaison, had come to the conclusion that fate itself had thrown them together at the corner of Tverskaya and that lane, and that they had been created for each other for all time. Ivan learned from the guest's story how the lovers would spend the day. She would come, and put on an apron first thing, and in the narrow front hall where stood that same sink of which the poor patient was for some reason so proud, would light the kerosene stove on the wooden table, prepare lunch, and set it out on the oval table in the first room. When the May storms came and water rushed noisily through the gateway past the near-sighted windows, threatening to flood their last refuge, the lovers would light the stove and bake potatoes in it. Steam rose from the potatoes, the black potato skins dirtied their fingers. Laughter came from the basement, the trees in the garden after rain shed broken twigs, white clusters.

5881,"The man who called himself a master worked feverishly on his novel, and this novel also absorbed the unknown woman. 'Really, there were times when I'd begin to be jealous of it on account of her,' the night visitor come from the moonlit balcony whispered to Ivan. Her slender fingers with sharply filed nails buried in her hair, she endlessly reread what he had written, and after rereading it would sit sewing that very same cap. Sometimes she crouched down by the lower shelves or stood by the upper ones and wiped the hundreds of dusty spines with a cloth. She foretold fame, she urged him on, and it was then that she began to call him a master. She waited impatiently for the already promised last words about the fifth procurator of Judea, repeated aloud in a sing-song voice certain phrases she liked, and said that her life was in this novel. It was finished in the month of August, was given to some unknown typist, and she typed it in five copies. And finally the hour came when he had to leave his secret refuge and go out into life. `And I went out into life holding it in my hands, and then my life ended,' the master whispered and drooped his head, and for a long time nodded the woeful black cap with the yellow letter  'M' on it.

5883,"Saving nothing about the essence of the novel, he asked me who I was, where I came from, and how long I had been writing, and why no one had heard of me before, and even asked what in my opinion was a totally idiotic question: who had given me the idea of writing a novel on such a strange theme? Finally I got sick of him and asked directly whether he would publish the novel or not. Here he started squirming, mumbled something, and declared that he could not decide the question on his own, that other members of the editorial board had to acquaint themselves with my work - namely, the critics Latunsky and Ariman, and the writer Mstislav Lavrovich. [2] He asked me to come in two weeks. I came in two weeks and was received by some girl whose eyes were crossed towards her nose from constant lying. '  That's Lapshennikova, the editorial secretary,' Ivan said with a smirk. He knew very well the world described so wrathfully by his guest. `Maybe,' the other snapped, 'and so from her I got my novel back, already quite greasy and dishevelled.

'  The story of Ivan's guest was becoming more confused, more filled with all sorts of reticences. He said something about slanting rain and despair in the basement refuge, about having gone elsewhere. He exclaimed in a whisper that he did not blame her in the least for pushing him to fight - oh, no, he did not blame her! Further on, as Ivan heard, something sudden and strange happened. One day our hero opened a newspaper and saw in it an article by the critic Ariman, [3] in which Ariman warned all and sundry that he, that is, our hero, had attempted to foist into print an apology for Jesus Christ.

Two days later in another newspaper, over the signature of Mstislav Lavrovich, appeared another article, in which its author recommended striking, and striking hard, at Pilatism and at the icon-dauber who had ventured to foist it (again that accursed word! ) into print. 'Dumbfounded by this unheard-of word  ""Pilatism"", I opened a third newspaper. There were two articles in it, one by Latunsky, the other signed with the initials  ""N.E.""  I assure you, the works of Ariman and Lavrovich could be counted as jokes compared with what Latunsky wrote. Suffice it to say that Latunsky's article was entitled  ""A Militant Old Believer"".

5886,"First she rushed to kiss me, then, in a hoarse voice, and pounding the table with her fist, she said she would poison Latunsky. '  Ivan grunted somewhat embarrassedly, but said nothing. 'Joyless autumn days set in,' the guest went on. 'The monstrous failure with this novel seemed to have taken out a part of my soul. Essentially speaking, I had nothing more to do, and I lived from one meeting with her to the next. And it was at that time that something happened to me.

5887,"But the more of them that appeared, the more my attitude towards them changed. The second stage was one of astonishment. Some rare falsity and insecurity could be sensed literally in every line of these articles, despite their threatening and confident tone. I had the feeling, and I couldn't get rid of it, that the authors of these articles were not saying what they wanted to say, and that their rage sprang precisely from that. And then, imagine, a third stage came - of fear. No, not fear of these articles, you understand, but fear of other things totally unrelated to them or to the novel. Thus, for instance, I began to be afraid of the dark. In short, the stage of mental illness came. It seemed to me, especially as I was falling asleep, that some very cold and pliant octopus was stealing with its tentacles immediately and directly towards my heart.

She said I should drop everything and go to the south, to the Black Sea, and spend all that was left of the hundred thousand on the trip. 'She was very insistent, and to avoid an argument (something told me I was not to go to the Black Sea),I promised her that I'd do it one of those days. But she said she would buy me the ticket herself. Then I took out all my money - that is, about ten thousand roubles - and gave it to her. ' ""Why so much""? she was surprised. 'I said something or other about being afraid of thieves and asked her to keep the money until my departure. She took it, put it in her purse, began kissing me and saying that it would be easier for her to die than to leave me alone in such a state, but that she was expected, that she must bow to necessity, that she would come the next day.

5889,"'This was at dusk, in mid-October. And she left. I lay down on the sofa and fell asleep without turning on the light. I was awakened by the feeling that the octopus was there. Groping in the dark, I barely managed to turn on the light. My pocket watch showed two o'clock in the morning. I was falling ill when I went to bed, and I woke up sick. It suddenly seemed to me that the autumn darkness would push through the glass and pour into the room, and I would drown in it as in ink. I got up a man no longer in control of himself.

When the wood began to crackle and the stove door rattled, I seemed to feel slightly better. I dashed to the front room, turned on the light there, found a bottle of white wine, uncorked it and began drinking from the bottle. This blunted the fear somewhat - at least enough to keep me from running to me landlord - and I went back to me stove. I opened the little door, so that the heat began to burn my face and hands, and whispered:  ' ""Guess that trouble has befallen me ...  Come, come, come! ...""  'But no one came.

5891,"This was terribly hard to do, because written-on paper burns reluctantly. Breaking my fingernails, I tore up the notebooks, stuck them vertically between the logs, and ruffled the pages with the poker. At times the ashes got the best of me, choking the flames, but I struggled with them, and the novel, though stubbornly resisting, was nevertheless perishing. Familiar words flashed before me, the yellow climbed steadily up the pages, but the words still showed through it. They would vanish only when the paper turned black, and I finished them off with the poker. `Just then someone began scratching quietly at the window. My heart leaped, and having stuffed the last notebook into the fire, I rushed to open the door. Brick steps led up from the basement to the door on the yard.

I could only utter the word:  ' ""You ... you? ..."", and my voice broke, and we ran downstairs. `She freed herself of her overcoat in the front hall, and we quickly went into the first room. With a soft cry, she pulled out of the stove with her bare hands and threw on to the floor the last of what was there, a sheaf that had caught fire from below. Smoke filled the room at once.

She neatly stacked the pages, wrapped them in paper, tied them with a ribbon. All her actions showed that she was full of determination, and that she had regained control of herself. She asked for wine and, having drunk it, spoke more calmly:  ' ""This is how one pays for lying,"" she said, ""and I don't want to lie any more.

When everything grew still, the guest came back and announced that room 120 had received an occupant. Someone had been brought, and he kept asking to be given back his head. The two interlocutors fell anxiously silent, but, having calmed down, they returned to the interrupted story. The guest was just opening his mouth, but the night was indeed a restless one. There were still voices in the corridor, and the guest began to speak into Ivan's ear, so softly that what he told him was known only to the poet, apart from the first phrase:  'A quarter of an hour after she left me, there came a knock at my window ...'

Behind me were snowdrifts that hid the lilac bushes, and before me and below - my little windows, dimly lit, covered with shades. I bent down to the first of them and listened - a gramophone was playing in my rooms. That was all I heard, but I could not see anything. I stood there a while, then went out the gate to the lane. A blizzard was frolicking in it. A dog, dashing under my feet, frightened me, and I ran away from it to the other side. The cold, and the fear that had become my constant companion, were driving me to frenzy. I had nowhere to go, and the simplest thing, of course, would have been to throw myself under a tram-car on the street where my lane came out.

Yes, there is no illness in this place worse than mine, I assure you! '  `But you could have let her know,' said Ivan, sympathizing with the poor patient. 'Besides, she has your money. She did keep it, of course? '  'You needn't doubt that, of course she kept it. But you evidently don't understand me. Or, rather, I've lost the ability I once had for describing things.

You're joking, my friend! Make her unhappy? No, I'm not capable of that. '  Ivan was unable to object to this, but the silent Ivan sympathized with the guest, he commiserated with him. And the other, from the pain of his memories, nodded his head in the black cap and spoke thus:  'Poor woman ...  However, I have hopes that she has forgotten me ...'  'But you may recover ...'

5905,"That in itself never bodes anything pleasant. But when it was repeated and, to assist it, another joined in, more authoritative and prolonged, and to them was added a clearly audible guffawing and even some hooting, the findirector understood at once that something else scandalous and vile had happened in the street. And that, however much he wanted to wave it away, it was closely connected with the repulsive s�ance presented by the black magician and his assistants. The keen-eared findirector was not mistaken in the least. As soon as he cast a glance out the window on to Sadovaya, his face twisted, and he did not whisper but hissed:  'So I thought! '  In the bright glare of the strongest street lights he saw, just below him on the sidewalk, a lady in nothing but a shift and violet bloomers. True, there was a little hat on the lady's head and an umbrella in her hands. The lady, who was in a state of utter consternation, now crouching down, now making as if to run off somewhere, was surrounded by an agitated crowd, which produced the very guffawing that had sent a shiver down the fin-director's spine. Next to the lady some citizen was flitting about, trying to tear off his summer coat, and in his agitation simply unable to manage the sleeve in which his arm was stuck.

A policeman made for the unfortunate woman, drilling the air with his whistle, and after the policeman hastened some merry young men in caps. It was they who produced the guffawing and hooting. A skinny, moustachioed cabby flew up to the first undressed woman and dashingly reined in his bony, broken-down nag. The moustached face was grinning gleefully. Rimsky beat himself on the head with his fist, spat, and leaped back from the window. For some time he sat at his desk listening to the street.

Twice the upset director put his hand on the receiver, and twice he drew it back. And suddenly, in the dead silence of the office, the telephone burst out ringing by itself right in the findirector's face, and he gave a start and went cold. 'My nerves are really upset, though!

5908,"With goose-flesh prickling on his back, the findirector hung up the telephone and for some reason turned to look at the window behind him. Through the scant and still barely greening branches of a maple, he saw the moon racing in a transparent cloud. His eyes fixed on the branches for some reason, Rimsky went on gazing at them, and the longer he gazed, the more strongly he was gripped by fear. With great effort, the findirector finally turned away from the moonlit window and stood up. There could no longer be any question of phone calls, and now the findirector was thinking of only one thing - getting out of the theatre as quickly as possible. He listened: the theatre building was silent. Rimsky realized that he had long been the only one on the whole second floor, and a childish, irrepressible fear came over him at this thought. He could not think without shuddering of having to walk alone now along the empty corridors and down the stairs. Feverishly he seized the hypnotist's banknotes from the table, put them in his briefcase, and coughed so as to cheer himself up at least a little.

5909,"And here it seemed to him that a whiff of some putrid dankness was coming in under the office door. Shivers ran down the findirector's spine. And then the clock also rang out unexpectedly and began to strike midnight. And even its striking provoked shivers in the findirector. But his heart definitively sank when he heard the English key turning quietly in the lock. Clutching his briefcase with damp, cold hands, the findirector felt that if this scraping in the keyhole were to go on any longer, he would break down and give a piercing scream. Finally the door yielded to someone's efforts, opened, and Varenukha noiselessly entered the office. Rimsky simply sank down into the armchair where he stood, because his legs gave way. Drawing a deep breath, he smiled an ingratiating smile, as it were, and said quietly:  'God, you frightened me...'  Yes, this sudden appearance might have frightened anyone you like, and yet at the same time it was a great joy: at least one little end peeped out in this tangled affair.

5910,"Well? Well? ' Rimsky wheezed, grasping at this little end. 'What does it all mean? ! '  `Excuse me, please,' the entering man replied in a hollow voice, closing the door, 'I thought you had already left. '  And Varenukha, without taking his cap off, walked to the armchair and sat on the other side of the desk. It must be said that Varenukha's response was marked by a slight oddity which at once needled the findirector, who could compete in sensitivity with the seismograph of any of the world's best stations.

And second, whichever entrance to the building Varenukha had used, he would inevitably have met one of the night-watchmen, to all of whom it had been announced that Grigory Danilovich was staying late in his office. But the findirector did not spend long pondering this oddity - he had other problems. 'Why didn't you call? What are all these shenanigans about Yalta?

5913,"And maybe Stepan Bogdanovich would achieve something worse than dismissal... The details! ' said Rimsky, banging the paperweight on the desk. And Varenukha began giving the details. As soon as he arrived where the findirector had sent him, he was received at once and given a most attentive hearing. No one, of course, even entertained the thought that Styopa could be in Yalta. Everyone agreed at once with Varenukha's suggestion that Likhodeev was, of course, at the Yalta in Pushkino. `Then where is he now? ' the agitated findirector interrupted the administrator.

'  Varenukha went on with his story, and the more he told, the more vividly there unfolded before the findirector the long chain of Likhodeev's boorish and outrageous acts, and every link in this chain was worse than the one before. The drunken dancing in the arms of the telegrapher on the lawn in front of the Pushkino telegraph office to the sounds of some itinerant barrel-organ was worth something! The chase after some female citizens shrieking with terror! The attempt at a fight with the barman in the Yalta itself! Scattering green onions all over the floor of the same Yalta.

5915,"Threatening to arrest the citizens who attempted to stop Styopa's obnoxiousness...  In short, black horror! Styopa was well known in Moscow theatre circles, and everyone knew that the man was no gift. But all the same, what the administrator was telling about him was too much even for Styopa. Yes, too much. Even much too much...  Rimsky's needle-sharp glance pierced the administrator's face from across the desk, and the longer the man spoke, the grimmer those eyes became. The more lifelike and colourful the vile details with which the administrator furnished his story, the less the findirector believed the storyteller. And when Varenukha told how Styopa had let himself go so far as to try to resist those who came to bring him back to Moscow, the findirector already knew firmly that everything the administrator who had returned at midnight was telling him, everything, was a lie! A lie from first word to last! Varenukha never went to Pushkino, and there was no Styopa in Pushkino.

5916,"As soon as the findirector became firmly convinced that the administrator was lying to him, fear crept over his body, starting from the legs, and twice again the findirector fancied that a putrid malarial dankness was wafting across the floor. Never for a moment taking his eyes off the administrator - who squirmed somehow strangely in his armchair, trying not to get out of the blue shade of the desk lamp, and screening himself with a newspaper in some remarkable fashion from the bothersome light - the findirector was thinking of only one thing: what did it all mean? Why was he being lied to so brazenly, in the silent and deserted building, by the administrator who was so late in coming back to him? And the awareness of danger, an unknown but menacing danger, began to gnaw at Rimsky's soul. Pretending to ignore Varenukha's dodges and tricks with the newspaper, the findirector studied his face, now almost without listening to the yarn Varenukha was spinning. There was something that seemed still more inexplicable than the calumny invented. God knows why, about adventures in Pushkino, and that something was the change in the administrator's appearance and manners. No matter how the man pulled the duck-like visor of his cap over his eyes, so as to throw a shadow on his face, no matter how he fidgeted with the newspaper, the findirector managed to make out an enormous bruise on the right side of his face just by the nose. Besides that, the normally full-blooded administrator was now pale with a chalk-like, unhealthy pallor, and on this stifling night his neck was for some reason wrapped in an old striped scarf. Add to that the repulsive manner the administrator had acquired during the time of his absence of sucking and smacking, the sharp change in his voice, which had become hollow and coarse, and the furtiveness and cowardliness in his eyes, and one could boldly say that Ivan Savelyevich Varenukha had become unrecognizable.",test,2,3,0,soon findirector became firmly convinced administrator lying fear crept body starting legs twice findirector fancied putrid malarial dankness wafting across floor moment taking eyes administrator squirmed somehow strangely armchair trying get blue shade desk lamp screening newspaper remarkable fashion bothersome light findirector thinking one thing mean lied brazenly silent deserted building administrator late coming back awareness danger unknown menacing danger began gnaw soul ignore dodges tricks newspaper findirector studied face almost without listening yarn spinning something seemed still inexplicable calumny invented knows adventures something change administrators appearance manners matter man pulled ducklike visor cap eyes throw shadow face matter fidgeted newspaper findirector managed make enormous bruise right side face nose normally fullblooded administrator pale chalklike unhealthy pallor stifling night neck reason wrapped old striped scarf repulsive manner administrator acquired time absence sucking smacking sharp change voice become hollow coarse furtiveness cowardliness eyes one could boldly say become unrecognizable
5917,"Something else burningly troubled the findirector, but he was unable to grasp precisely what it was, however much he strained his feverish mind, however hard he peered at Varenukha. One thing he could affirm, that there was something unprecedented, unnatural in this combination of the administrator and the familiar armchair. ""Well, we finally overpowered him, loaded him into the car,' Varenukha boomed, peeking from behind the paper and covering the bruise with his hand. Rimsky suddenly reached out and, as if mechanically, tapping his fingers on the table at the same time, pushed the electric-bell button with his palm and went numb. The sharp signal ought to have been heard without fail in the empty building. But no signal came, and the button sank lifelessly into the wood of the desk. The button was dead, the bell broken. The findirector's stratagem did not escape the notice of Varenukha, who asked, twitching, with a clearly malicious fire flickering in his eyes:  ""What are you ringing for? '  'Mechanically,' the findirector replied hollowly, jerking his hand back, and asked in turn, in an unsteady voice: ""What's that on your face?

5918,"'He's lying! ' the findirector exclaimed mentally. And here his eyes suddenly grew round and utterly insane, and he stared at the back of the armchair. Behind the chair on the floor two shadows lay criss-cross, one more dense and black, the other faint and grey. The shadow of the back of the chair and of its tapering legs could be seen distinctly on the floor, but there was no shadow of Varenukha's head above the back of the chair, or of the administrator's legs under its legs. `He casts no shadow! ' Rimsky cried out desperately in his mind. He broke into shivers. Varenukha, following Rimsky's insane gaze, looked furtively behind him at the back of the chair, and realized that he had been found out. He got up from the chair (the findirector did likewise) and made one step back from the desk, clutching his briefcase in his hands.",test,2,1,0,lying findirector exclaimed mentally eyes suddenly grew round utterly insane stared back armchair chair floor two shadows lay crisscross one dense black faint grey shadow back chair tapering legs could seen distinctly floor shadow head back chair administrators legs legs casts shadow cried desperately mind broke shivers following insane gaze looked furtively behind back chair realized found got chair findirector likewise made one step back desk clutching briefcase hands
5919,"'He's guessed, damn him! Always was clever,' Varenukha said, grinning spitefully right in the findirector's face, and he sprang unexpectedly from the chair to the door and quickly pushed down the catch on the lock. The findirector looked desperately behind him, as he retreated to the window giving on to the garden, and in this window, flooded with moonlight, saw the face of a naked girl pressed against the glass and her naked arm reaching through the vent-pane and trying to open the lower latch. The upper one was already open. It seemed to Rimsky that the light of the desk lamp was going out and the desk was tilting. An icy wave engulfed Rimsky, but - fortunately for him - he got control of himself and did not fall. He had enough strength left to whisper, but not cry out:  'Help...'  Varenukha, guarding the door, hopped up and down by it, staying in air for a long time and swaying there. Waving his hooked fingers in Rimsky's direction, he hissed and smacked, winking to the girl in the window. She began to hurry, stuck her red-haired head through the vent, reached her arm down as far as she could, her nails clawing at the lower latch and shaking the frame.

5920,"Finally the dead woman's green fingers got hold of the latch knob, turned it, and the frame began to open. Rimsky cried out weakly, leaned against the wall, and held his briefcase in front of him like a shield. He realized that his end had come. The frame swung wide open, but instead of the night's freshness and the fragrance of the lindens, the smell of a cellar burst into the room. The dead woman stepped on to the window-sill. Rimsky clearly saw spots of decay on her breast. And just then the joyful, unexpected crowing of a cock came from the garden, from that low building beyond the shooting gallery where birds participating in the programme were kept. A loud, trained cock trumpeted, announcing that dawn was rolling towards Moscow from the east. Savage fury distorted the girl's face, she emitted a hoarse oath, and at the door Varenukha shrieked and dropped from the air to the floor.

5921,"With the third crowing of the cock, she turned and flew out and after her, jumping up and stretching himself horizontally in the air, looking like a flying cupid, Varenukha slowly floated over the desk and out the window. White as snow, with not a single black hair on his head, the old man who still recently had been Rimsky rushed to the door, undid the catch, opened the door, and ran hurtling down the dark corridor. At the turn to the stairs, moaning with fear, he felt for the switch, and the stairway lighted up. On the stairs the shaking, trembling old man fell because he imagined that Varenukha had softly tumbled on top of him. Having run downstairs, Rimsky saw a watchman asleep on a chair by the box office in the lobby. Rimsky stole past him on tiptoe and slipped out the main entrance. Outside he felt slightly better. He recovered his senses enough to realize, clutching his head, that his hat had stayed behind in the office. Needless to say, he did not go back for it, but, breathless, ran across the wide street to the opposite corner by the movie theatre, near which a dull reddish light hovered.

5922,"No one had time to intercept the cab. `Make the Leningrad express, I'll tip you well,' the old man said, breathing heavily and clutching his heart. 'I'm going to the garage,' the driver answered hatefully and turned away. Then Rimsky unlatched his briefcase, took out fifty roubles, and handed them to the driver through the open front window. A few moments later, the rattling car was flying like the wind down Sadovoye Ring. The passenger was tossed about on his seat, and in the fragment of mirror hanging in front of the driver, Rimsky saw now the driver's happy eyes, now his own insane ones. Jumping out of the car in front of the train station, Rimsky cried to the first man he saw in a white apron with a badge:  'First class, single, I'll pay thirty,' he was pulling the banknotes from his briefcase, crumpling them, 'no first class, get me second ... if not -- a hard bench!

He recalled only a desk, a bookcase and a sofa. There a conversation was held with Nikanor Ivanovich, who had some sort of haze before his eyes from the rush of blood and mental agitation, but the conversation came out somehow strange, muddled, or, better to say, did not come out at all. The very first question put to Nikanor Ivanovich was the following:  'Are you Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy, chairman of the house committee at no. 502-bis on Sadovaya Street?

'If you want,' he mumbled, 'I'll eat dirt that I didn't do it! And Koroviev - he's the devil! '  All patience has its limits, and the voice at the desk was now raised, hinting to Nikanor Ivanovich that it was time he began speaking in human language.

Trembling, he made crosses in the air, rushing to the door and back, intoned some prayer, and finally began spouting sheer gibberish. It became perfectly clear that Nikanor Ivanovich was unfit for any conversation. He was taken out and put in a separate room, where he calmed down somewhat and only prayed and sobbed.

With that they left Sadovaya, and there also departed with them the perplexed and dispirited secretary of the house management, Bedsornev. In the evening Nikanor Ivanovich was delivered to Stravinsky's clinic. There he became so agitated that an injection, made according to Stravinsky's recipe, had to be given him, and only after midnight did Nikanor Ivanovich fall asleep in room 119, every now and then emitting a heavy, painful moan. But the longer he slept, the easier his sleep became. He stopped tossing and groaning, his breathing became easy and regular, and he was left alone. Then Nikanor Ivanovich was visited by a dream, at the basis of which undoubtedly lay the experience of that day. It began with Nikanor Ivanovich seeing as it were some people with golden trumpets in their hands leading him, and very solemnly, to a big lacquered door. At this door his companions played as it were a nourish for Nikanor Ivanovich, and then from the sky a resounding bass said merrily:  'Welcome, Nikanor Ivanovich, turn over your currency!

5929,"Then he found himself for some reason in a theatre house, where crystal chandeliers blazed under a gilded ceiling and Quinquet lamps [2] on the walls. Everything was as it ought to be in a small-sized but very costly theatre. There was a stage closed off by a velvet curtain, its dark cerise background spangled, as if with stars, with oversized gold pieces, there was a prompter's box, and there was even an audience. What surprised Nikanor Ivanovich was that this audience was all of the same sex - male - and all for some reason bearded. Besides that, it was striking that there were no seats in the theatre, and the audience was all sitting on the floor, splendidly polished and slippery. Abashed in this new and big company, Nikanor Ivanovich, after a brief hesitation, followed the general example and sat down on the parquet Turkish-fashion, huddled between some stalwart, bearded redhead and another citizen, pale and quite overgrown. None of the sitters paid any attention to the newly arrived spectator. Here the soft ringing of a bell was heard, the lights in the house went out, and the curtain opened to reveal a lighted stage with an armchair, a little table on which stood a golden bell, and a solid black velvet backdrop. An artiste came out from the wings in an evening jacket, smoothly shaven, his hair neatly parted, young and with very pleasant features.

5930,"The artiste advanced to the prompter's box and rubbed his hands. 'All sitting? '[3] he asked in a soft baritone and smiled to the house. 'Sitting, sitting,' a chorus of tenors and basses answered from the house. 'Hm ...' the artiste began pensively, 'and how you're not sick of it. I just don't understand! Everybody else is out walking around now, enjoying the spring sun and the warmth, and you're stuck in here on the floor of a stuffy theatre! Is the programme so interesting? Tastes differ, however,' the artiste concluded philosophically. Then he changed both the timbre of his voice and its intonation, and announced gaily and resoundingly:  `And now for the next number on our programme - Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy, chairman of a house committee and director of a dietetic kitchen.",test,2,2,0,artiste advanced prompters box rubbed hands sitting asked soft baritone smiled house sitting chorus tenors basses answered house artiste began pensively youre sick dont understand else walking around enjoying spring sun warmth youre stuck floor stuffy theatre programme interesting differ however artiste concluded philosophically changed timbre voice intonation announced gaily resoundingly next number programme chairman house committee director dietetic kitchen
5931,"Nikanor Ivanovich, on-stage! '  General applause greeted the artiste. The surprised Nikanor Ivanovich goggled his eyes, while the master of ceremonies, blocking the glare of the footlights with his hand, located him among the sitters and tenderly beckoned him on-stage with his finger. And Nikanor Ivanovich, without knowing how, found himself on-stage. Beams of coloured light struck his eyes from in front and below, which at once caused the house and the audience to sink into darkness. 'Well, Nikanor Ivanovich, set us a good example, sir,' the young artiste said soulfully, 'turn over your currency. '  Silence ensued. Nikanor Ivanovich took a deep breath and quietly began to speak:  'I swear to God that I...'  But before he had time to get the words out, the whole house burst into shouts of indignation.

'Right,' responded the artiste, 'and... excuse the indiscretion, where did the four hundred dollars that were found in the privy of the apartment of which you and your wife are the sole inhabitants come from? '  'Magic! ' someone in the dark house said with obvious irony. 'Exactly right - magic,' Nikanor Ivanovich timidly replied, vaguely addressing either the artiste or the dark house, and he explained: 'Unclean powers, the checkered interpreter stuck me with them. '  And again the house raised an indignant roar. When silence came, the artiste said:  'See what La Fontaine fables I have to listen to! Stuck him with four hundred dollars!

A middle-aged lady came out from the wings, fashionably dressed - that is, in a collarless coat and a tiny hat. The lady looked worried, but Dunchil glanced at her without moving an eyebrow. 'Who is this lady? ' the programme announcer asked Dunchil. 'That is my wife,' Dunchil replied with dignity and looked at the lady's long neck with a certain repugnance.

Dunchil took a step back and his face went pale. The house froze. 'Eighteen thousand dollars and a necklace worth forty thousand in gold,' the artiste solemnly announced, `kept by Sergei Gerardovich in the city of Kharkov, in the apartment of his mistress, Ida Herkulanovna Vors, whom we have the pleasure of seeing here before us and who so kindly helped in discovering these treasures - priceless, vet useless in the hands of a private person.

When the front curtain went up, there was no one on-stage except the lone artiste. Greeted with a second burst of applause, he bowed and began to speak:  'In the person of this Dunchil, our programme has shown you a typical ass. I did have the pleasure of saying yesterday that the concealing of currency is senseless. No one can make use of it under any circumstances, I assure you. Let's take this same Dunchil.

In that case, for the next number on our programme, a famous dramatic talent, the actor Kurolesov, Sawa Potapovich, especially invited here, will perform excerpts from The Covetous Knight [4] by the poet Pushkin. '  The promised Kurolesov was not slow in coming on stage and turned out to be a strapping and beefy man, clean-shaven, in a tailcoat and white tie. Without any preliminaries, he concocted a gloomy face, knitted his brows, and began speaking in an unnatural voice, glancing sidelong at the golden bell:  `As a young scapegrace awaits a tryst with some sly strumpet...'[5]  And Kurolesov told many bad things about himself. Nikanor Ivanovich heard Kurolesov confess that some wretched widow had gone on her knees to him, howling, in the rain, but had failed to move the actor's callous heart. Before his dream, Nikanor Ivanovich had been completely ignorant of the poet Pushkin's works, but the man himself he knew perfectly well and several times a day used to say phrases like:  'And who's going to pay the rent - Pushkin? '[6] or `Then who did unscrew the bulb on the stairway - Pushkin? ' or  'So who's going to buy the fuel - Pushkin?

5940,"'  And the latter, ever raising his voice, went on with his confession and got Nikanor Ivanovich definitively muddled, because he suddenly started addressing someone who was not on-stage, and responded for this absent one himself, calling himself now dear sir, now baron, now father, now son, now formally, and now familiarly. Nikanor Ivanovich understood only one thing, that the actor died an evil death, crying out:  'Keys! My keys! ', after which he collapsed on the floor, gasping and carefully tearing off his tie. Having died, Kurolesov got up, brushed the dust from his trousers, bowed with a false smile, and withdrew to the accompaniment of thin applause. And the master of ceremonies began speaking thus:  'We have just heard The Covetous Knight wonderfully performed by Sawa Potapovich. This knight hoped that frolicking nymphs would come running to him, and that many other pleasant things in the same vein would occur. But, as you see, none of it happened, no nymphs came running to him, and the muses paid him no tribute, and he raised no mansions, but, on the contrary, ended quite badly, died of a stroke, devil take him, on his chest of currency and jewels.

Really, Kanavkin, for shame! You're a grown-up! '  Kanavkin no longer knew what to do with himself, and merely picked at the lapel of his jacket with his finger.

But, thanks to his cries, alarm was communicated to room 120, where the patient woke up and began looking for his head, and to room 118, where the unknown master became restless and wrung his hands in anguish, looking at the moon, remembering the last bitter autumn night of his life, a strip of light under the basement door, and uncurled hair.",test,2,2,0,cooks melted away theatre curtain broke tears made room hospital two people white coats means casual cooks getting people advice doctor holding bowl little dish covered gauze syringe lying said bitterly giving injection dont thats turn currency dont dont dont kindhearted soothed dont theres said injection felt better fell asleep without dreams thanks cries alarm communicated room patient woke began looking head room unknown master became restless wrung hands anguish looking moon remembering last bitter autumn night life strip light basement door uncurled hair
5952,"From room 118, the alarm flew by way of the balcony to Ivan, and he woke up and began to weep. But the doctor quickly calmed all these anxious, sorrowing heads, and they began to fall asleep. Ivan was the last to become oblivious, as dawn was already breaking over the river. After the medicine, which suffused his whole body, calm came like a wave and covered him. His body grew lighter, his head basked in the warm wind of reverie. He fell asleep, and the last waking thing he heard was the pre-dawn chirping of birds in the woods. But they soon fell silent, and he began dreaming that the sun was already going down over Bald Mountain, and the mountain was cordoned off by a double cordon ...  CHAPTER 16  The Execution  The sun was already going down over Bald Mountain, and the mountain was cordoned off by a double cordon. The cavalry ala that had cut across the procurator's path around noon came trotting up to the Hebron gate of the city. Its way had already been prepared. The infantry of the Cappadocian cohort had pushed the conglomeration of people, mules and camels to the sides, and the ala, trotting and raising white columns of dust in the sky, came to an intersection where two roads met: the south road leading to Bethlehem, and the north-west road to Jaffa.",test,2,2,0,room alarm flew way balcony woke began weep doctor quickly calmed anxious sorrowing heads began fall asleep last become oblivious dawn already breaking river medicine suffused whole body calm came like wave covered body grew lighter head basked warm wind reverie fell asleep last waking thing heard predawn chirping birds woods soon fell silent began dreaming sun already going mountain cordoned double cordon sun already going mountain cordoned double cordon cavalry ala cut across procurators path around noon came trotting gate city way already prepared infantry cohort pushed conglomeration people mules camels sides ala trotting raising white columns dust sky came intersection two roads met south road leading northwest road
5953,"The ala raced down the north-west road. The same Cappadocians were strung out along the sides of the road, and in good time had driven to the sides of it all the caravans hastening to the feast in Yershalaim. Crowds of pilgrims stood behind the Cappadocians, having abandoned their temporary striped tents, pitched right on the grass. Going on for about a half-mile, the ala caught up with the second cohort of the Lightning legion and, having covered another half-mile, was the first to reach the foot of Bald Mountain. Here they dismounted. The commander broke the ala up into squads, and they cordoned off the whole foot of the small hill, leaving open only the way up from the Jaffa road. After some time, the ala was joined at the hill by the second cohort, which climbed one level higher and also encircled the hill in a wreath. Finally the century under the command of Mark Ratslayer arrived. It went stretched out in files along the sides of the road, and between these files, convoyed by the secret guard, the three condemned men rode in a cart, white boards hanging around their necks with 'robber and rebel' written on each of them in two languages - Aramaic and Greek. The cart with the condemned men was followed by others laden with freshly hewn posts with crosspieces, ropes, shovels, buckets and axes.",test,2,2,0,ala raced northwest road strung along sides road good time driven sides caravans hastening feast pilgrims stood behind abandoned temporary striped tents pitched right grass halfmile ala caught second cohort legion covered another halfmile first reach foot dismounted commander broke ala squads cordoned whole foot small hill leaving open way road time ala joined hill second cohort climbed one level higher also encircled hill wreath century command arrived went stretched files along sides road files convoyed secret guard three condemned men rode cart white boards hanging around necks rebel written two languages cart condemned men followed others laden freshly hewn posts crosspieces ropes shovels buckets axes
5954,"Six executioners rode in these carts. They were followed on horseback by the centurion Mark, the chief of the temple guard of Yershalaim, and that same hooded man with whom Pilate had had a momentary meeting in a darkened room of the palace. A file of soldiers brought up the rear of the procession, and behind it walked about two thousand of the curious, undaunted by the infernal heat and wishing to be present at the interesting spectacle. The curious from the city were now joined by the curious from among the pilgrims, who were admitted without hindrance to the tail of the procession. Under the shrill cries of the heralds who accompanied the column and cried aloud what Pilate had cried out at around noon, the procession drew itself up Bald Mountain. The ala admitted everyone to the second level, but the second century let only those connected with the execution go further up, and then, manoeuvring quickly, spread the crowd around the entire hill, so that people found themselves between the cordons of infantry above and cavalry below. Now they could watch the execution through the sparse line of the infantry. And so, more than three hours had gone by since the procession climbed the mountain, and the sun was already going down over Bald Mountain, but the heat was still unbearable, and the soldiers in both cordons suffered from it, grew weary with boredom, and cursed the three robbers in their hearts, sincerely wishing them the speediest death. The little commander of the ala, his brow moist and the back of his white shirt dark with sweat, having placed himself at the foot of the hill by the open passage, went over to the leather bucket of the first squad every now and then, scooped handfuls of water from it, drank and wetted his turban. Somewhat relieved by that, he would step away and again begin pacing back and forth on the dusty road leading to the top.",test,2,3,0,executioners rode carts followed horseback centurion chief temple guard hooded man momentary meeting darkened room palace file soldiers brought rear procession behind walked two thousand curious undaunted infernal heat wishing present interesting spectacle curious city joined curious among pilgrims admitted without hindrance tail procession shrill cries heralds accompanied column cried aloud cried around noon procession drew ala admitted everyone second level second century let connected execution go manoeuvring quickly spread crowd around entire hill people found cordons infantry cavalry could watch execution sparse line infantry three hours gone since procession climbed mountain sun already going heat still unbearable soldiers cordons suffered grew weary boredom cursed three robbers hearts sincerely wishing speediest death little commander ala brow moist back white shirt dark sweat placed foot hill open passage went leather bucket first squad every scooped handfuls water drank wetted turban relieved would step away begin pacing back forth dusty road leading top
5955,"His long sword slapped against his laced leather boot. The commander wished to give his cavalrymen an example of endurance, but, pitying his soldiers, he allowed them to stick their spears pyramid-like in the ground and throw their white cloaks over them. Under these tents, the Syrians hid from the merciless sun. The buckets were quickly emptied, and cavalrymen from different squads took turns going to fetch water in the gully below the hill, where in the thin shade of spindly mulberries a muddy brook was living out its last days in the devilish heat. There, too, catching the unsteady shade, stood the bored horse-handlers, holding the quieted horses. The weariness of the soldiers and the abuse they aimed at the robbers were understandable. The procurator's apprehensions concerning the disorders that might occur at the time of the execution in the city of Yershalaim, so hated by him, fortunately were not borne out. And when the fourth hour of the execution came, there was, contrary to all expectations, not a single person left between the two files, the infantry above and the cavalry below. The sun had scorched the crowd and driven it back to Yershalaim. Beyond the file of two Roman centuries there were only two dogs that belonged to no one knew whom and had for some reason ended up on the hill.",test,2,2,0,long sword slapped laced leather boot commander wished give cavalrymen example endurance pitying soldiers allowed stick spears pyramidlike ground throw white cloaks tents hid merciless sun buckets quickly emptied cavalrymen different squads took turns going fetch water gully hill thin shade spindly mulberries muddy brook living last days devilish heat catching unsteady shade stood bored horsehandlers holding quieted horses weariness soldiers abuse aimed robbers understandable procurators apprehensions concerning disorders might occur time execution city hated fortunately borne fourth hour execution came contrary expectations single person left two files infantry cavalry sun scorched crowd driven back file two centuries two dogs belonged one knew reason ended hill
5956,"But the heat got to them, too, and they lay down with their tongues hanging out, panting and paying no attention to the green-backed lizards, the only beings not afraid of the sun, darting among the scorching stones and some sort of big-thorned plants that crept on the ground. No one attempted to rescue the condemned men either in Yershalaim itself, flooded with troops, or here on the cordoned-off hill, and the crowd went back to the city, for indeed there was absolutely nothing interesting in this execution, while there in the city preparations were under way for the great feast of Passover, which was to begin that evening. The Roman infantry on the second level suffered still more than the cavalry. The only thing the centurion Ratslayer allowed his soldiers was to take off their helmets and cover their heads with white headbands dipped in water, but he kept them standing, and with their spears in their hands. He himself, in the same kind of headband, but dry, not wet, walked about not far from the group of executioners, without even taking the silver plaques with lions' muzzles off his shirt, or removing his greaves, sword and knife. The sun beat straight down on the centurion without doing him any harm, and the lions' muzzles were impossible to look at - the eyes were devoured by the dazzling gleam of the silver which was as if boiling in the sun. Ratslayer's mutilated face expressed neither weariness nor displeasure, and it seemed that the giant centurion was capable of pacing like that all day, all night and the next day - in short, for as long as necessary. Of pacing in the same way, holding his hands to the heavy belt with its bronze plaques, glancing in the same stern way now at the posts with the executed men, now at the file of soldiers, kicking aside with the toe of a shaggy boot in the same indifferent way human bones whitened by time or small flints that happened under his feet.

5957,"There was one person, but he simply could not be seen by everyone. He had placed himself, not on the side where the way up the mountain was open and from where it would have been most convenient to watch the execution, but on the north side, where the slope was not gentle and accessible, but uneven, with gaps and clefts, where in a crevice, clutching at the heaven-cursed waterless soil, a sickly fig tree was trying to live. Precisely under it, though it gave no shade, this sole spectator who was not a participant in the execution had established himself, and had sat on a stone from the very beginning, that is, for over three hours now. Yes, he had chosen not the best but the worst position for watching the execution. But still, even from there the posts could be seen, and there could also be seen, beyond the file of soldiers, the two dazzling spots on the centurion's chest, and that was apparently quite enough for a man who obviously wished to remain little noticed and not be bothered by anyone. But some four hours ago, at the start of the execution, this man had behaved quite differently, and might have been noticed very well, which was probably why he had now changed his behaviour and secluded himself. It was only when the procession came to the very top, beyond the file, that he had first appeared, and as an obvious latecomer at that. He was breathing hard, and did not walk but ran up the hill, pushing his way, and, seeing the file close together before him as before everyone else, made a naive attempt, pretending he did not understand the angry shouts, to break through the soldiers to the very place of execution, where the condemned men were already being taken from the cart. For that he received a heavy blow in the chest with the butt end of a spear, and he leaped back from the soldiers, crying out not in pain but in despair. At the legionary who had dealt the blow he cast a dull glance, utterly indifferent to everything, like a man insensible to physical pain.",test,2,3,0,one person simply could seen everyone placed side way mountain open would convenient watch execution north side slope gentle accessible uneven gaps clefts crevice clutching heavencursed waterless soil sickly fig tree trying live though gave shade sole spectator participant execution established sat stone beginning three hours chosen best worst position watching execution still even posts could seen could also seen beyond file soldiers two dazzling spots centurions chest apparently quite enough man obviously wished remain little noticed bothered anyone four hours ago start execution man behaved quite differently might noticed well probably changed behaviour secluded procession came top beyond file first appeared obvious latecomer breathing hard walk ran hill pushing way seeing file close together everyone else made naive attempt pretending understand angry shouts break soldiers place execution condemned men already taken cart received heavy blow chest butt end spear leaped back soldiers crying pain despair legionary dealt blow cast dull glance utterly indifferent everything like man insensible physical pain
5958,"Coughing and breathless, clutching his chest, he ran around the hill, trying to find some gap in the file on the north side where he could slip through. But it was too late, the ring was closed. And the man, his face distorted with grief, was forced to renounce his attempts to break through to the carts, from which the posts had already been unloaded. These attempts would have led nowhere, except that he would have been seized, and to be arrested on that day by no means entered his plans. And so he went to the side, towards the crevice, where it was quieter and nobody bothered him. Now, sitting on the stone, this black-bearded man, his eyes festering from the sun and lack of sleep, was in anguish. First he sighed, opening his tallith, worn out in his wanderings, gone from light-blue to dirty grey, and bared his chest, which had been hurt by the spear and down which ran dirty sweat; then, in unendurable pain, he raised his eyes to the sky, following the three vultures that had long been floating in great circles on high, anticipating an imminent feast; then he peered with hopeless eyes into the yellow earth, and saw on it the half-destroyed skull of a dog and lizards scurrying around it. The man's sufferings were so great that at times he began talking to himself. 'Oh, fool that I am ...' he muttered, swaying on the stone in the pain of his heart and clawing his swarthy chest with his nails. 'Fool, senseless woman, coward!",test,2,3,0,breathless clutching chest ran around hill trying find gap file north side could slip late ring closed man face distorted grief forced renounce attempts break carts posts already unloaded attempts would led nowhere except would seized arrested day means entered plans went side towards crevice quieter nobody bothered sitting stone blackbearded man eyes festering sun lack sleep anguish sighed opening tallith worn wanderings gone lightblue dirty grey bared chest hurt spear ran dirty sweat unendurable pain raised eyes sky following three vultures long floating great circles high anticipating imminent feast peered hopeless eyes yellow earth saw halfdestroyed skull dog lizards scurrying around mans sufferings great times began talking fool muttered swaying stone pain heart clawing swarthy chest nails senseless woman coward
5959,"I'm not a man, I'm carrion! '  He would fall silent, hang his head, then, after drinking some warm water from a wooden flask, he would revive again and clutch now at the knife hidden on his chest under the tallith, now at the piece of parchment lying before him on the stone next to a stylus and a pot of ink. On this parchment some notes had already been scribbled:  The minutes run on, and I, Matthew Levi, am here on Bald Mountain, and still no death! '  Further:  The sun is sinking, but no death. '  Now Matthew Levi wrote hopelessly with the sharp stylus:  'God! Why are you angry with him? Send him death. '  Having written this, he sobbed tearlessly and again wounded his chest with his nails. The reason for Levi's despair lay in the terrible misfortune that had befallen Yeshua and him and, besides that, in the grave error that he, Levi, in his own opinion, had committed. Two days earlier, Yeshua and Levi had been in Bethphage near Yershalaim, where they had visited a certain gardener who liked Yeshua's preaching very much.",test,2,2,0,man carrion would fall silent hang head drinking warm water wooden flask would revive clutch knife hidden chest tallith piece parchment lying stone next stylus pot ink parchment notes already scribbled minutes run still death sun sinking death wrote hopelessly sharp stylus angry death written sobbed tearlessly wounded chest nails reason despair lay terrible misfortune befallen besides grave error opinion committed days earlier near visited certain gardener liked preaching much
5960,"The two visitors had spent the whole morning working in the garden, helping their host, and planned to go to Yershalaim towards evening when it cooled off. But Yeshua began to hurry for some reason, said he had urgent business in the city, and left alone around noontime. Here lay Matthew Levi's first error. Why, why had he let him go alone! Nor was Matthew Levi to go to Yershalaim that evening. He was struck by some unexpected and terrible ailment. He began to shake, his whole body was filled with fire, his teeth chattered, and he kept asking to drink all the time. He could not go anywhere. He collapsed on a horse blanket in the gardener's shed and lay there till dawn on Friday, when the illness released Levi as unexpectedly as it had fallen upon him. Though he was still weak and his legs trembled, he took leave of his host and, oppressed by some foreboding of disaster, went to Yershalaim.",test,2,2,0,two visitors spent whole morning working garden helping host planned go towards evening cooled began hurry reason said urgent business city left alone around noontime lay first error let go alone go evening struck unexpected terrible ailment began shake whole body filled fire teeth chattered kept asking drink time could go anywhere collapsed horse blanket gardeners shed lay till dawn illness released unexpectedly fallen upon still weak legs trembled took leave host oppressed foreboding disaster went
5961,"There he learned that his foreboding had not deceived him - the disaster occurred. Levi was in the crowd and heard the procurator announce the sentence. When the condemned men were led off to the mountain, Matthew Levi ran alongside the file in the crowd of the curious, trying to let Yeshua know in some inconspicuous way that at least he, Levi, was there with him, that he had not abandoned him on his last journey, and that he was praying that death would overtake Yeshua as soon as possible. But Yeshua, who was looking into the distance towards where he was being taken, of course did not see Levi. And then, when the procession had gone about a half-mile along the road, a simple and ingenious thought dawned on Matthew, who was being jostled by the crowd just next to the file, and in his excitement he at once showered himself with curses for not having thought of it earlier. The file of soldiers was not solid, there were spaces between them. Given great dexterity and a precise calculation, one could bend down, slip between two legionaries, make it to the cart and jump into it. Then Yeshua would be saved from suffering. One instant would be enough to stab Yeshua in the back with a knife, crying to him:  'Yeshua!

5962,"I, Matthew, your faithful and only disciple! '  And if God granted him one more free instant, he would also have time to stab himself and avoid death on a post. This last, however, was of little interest to Levi, the former tax collector. He was indifferent to how he died. He wanted one thing, that Yeshua, who had never in his life done the least evil to anyone, should escape torture. The plan was a very good one, but the fact of the matter was that Levi had no knife with him. Nor did he have a single piece of money. Furious with himself, Levi got out of the crowd and ran back to the city. A single feverish thought was leaping in his burning head: how to procure a knife there in the city, in any way possible, and have time to overtake the procession. He ran up to the city gate, manoeuvring amid the throng of caravans being sucked into the city, and saw to his left the open door of a little shop where bread was sold.",test,2,2,0,faithful disciple granted one free instant would also time stab avoid death post last however little interest former tax collector indifferent died wanted one thing never life done least evil anyone escape torture plan good one fact matter knife single piece money got crowd ran back city single feverish thought leaping burning head procure knife city way possible time overtake procession ran city gate manoeuvring amid throng caravans sucked city saw left open door little shop bread sold
5963,"Breathing hard after running down the scorched road, Levi got control of himself, entered the shop very sedately, greeted the woman behind the counter, asked her to take the top loaf from the shelf, which for some reason he liked better than the others, and when she turned around, silently and quickly took from the counter that than which there could be nothing better - a long, razor-sharp bread knife - and at once dashed out of the shop. A few moments later he was again on the Jaffa road. But the procession was no longer in sight. He ran. At times he had to drop down right in the dust and lie motionless to recover his breath. And so he would lie there, to the astonishment of people riding on mules or walking on foot to Yershalaim. He would lie listening to his heart pounding not only in his chest but in his head and ears. Having recovered his breath a little, he would jump up and continue running, but ever slower and slower. When he finally caught sight of the long procession raising dust in the distance, it was already at the foot of the hill.

5964,"...' Levi moaned, realizing that he was going to be too late. And he was too late. When the fourth hour of the execution had gone by, Levi's torments reached their highest degree and he fell into a rage. Getting up from the stone, he flung to the ground the stolen knife - stolen in vain, as he now thought - crushed the flask with his foot, depriving himself of water, threw off his kefia, seized his thin hair, and began cursing himself. He cursed himself, calling out meaningless words, growled and spat, abused his father and mother for bringing a fool into the world. Seeing that curses and abuse had no effect and nothing in the sun-scorched place was changed by them, he clenched his dry fists, raised them, squinting, to the sky, to the sun that was sliding ever lower, lengthening the shadows and going to fall into the Mediterranean, and demanded an immediate miracle from God. He demanded that God at once send Yeshua death. Opening his eyes, he became convinced that everything on the hill was unchanged, except that the blazing spots on the centurion's chest had gone out. The sun was sending its rays into the backs of the executed men, who were facing Yershalaim. Then Levi shouted:  'I curse you.",test,2,2,0,moaned realizing going late late fourth hour execution gone torments reached highest degree fell rage stone flung ground stolen knife stolen vain thought crushed flask foot depriving water threw kefia seized thin hair began cursing cursed calling meaningless words growled spat abused father mother bringing fool world curses abuse effect nothing sunscorched place changed clenched dry fists raised squinting sky sun sliding ever lower lengthening shadows going fall demanded immediate miracle demanded send death eyes became convinced everything hill unchanged except blazing spots centurions chest gone sun sending rays backs executed men facing shouted curse
5965,"God! '  In a rasping voice he shouted that he was convinced of God's injustice and did not intend to believe in him any longer. You are deaf! ' growled Levi. `If you were not deaf, you would have heard me and killed him straight away! '  Shutting his eyes, Levi waited for the fire that would fall from the sky and strike him instead. This did not happen, and Levi, without opening his eyes, went on shouting offensive and sarcastic things at the sky. He shouted about his total disappointment, about the existence of other gods and religions. Yes, another god would not have allowed it, he would never have allowed a man like Yeshua to be burnt by the sun on a post.

5966,"' Levi cried in a completely hoarse voice. 'You are a god of evil! Or are your eyes completely clouded by smoke from the temple censers, and have your ears ceased to hear anything but the trumpeting noises of the priests? You are not an almighty god! You are a black god! I curse you, god of robbers, their soul and their protector! '  Here something blew into the face of the former tax collector, and something rustled under his feet. It blew once more, and then, opening his eyes, Levi saw that, either under the influence of his curses, or owing to other reasons, everything in the world was changed. The sun had disappeared before reaching the sea, where it sank every evening. Having swallowed it, a storm cloud was rising menacingly and inexorably against the sky in the west.",test,2,1,0,cried completely hoarse voice god evil eyes completely clouded smoke temple censers ears ceased hear anything trumpeting noises priests almighty god black god curse god robbers soul protector something blew face former tax collector something rustled feet blew opening eyes saw either influence curses owing reasons everything world changed sun disappeared reaching sea sank every evening swallowed storm cloud rising menacingly inexorably sky west
5967,"Its edges were already seething with white foam, its black smoky belly was tinged with yellow. The storm cloud was growling, threads of fire fell from it now and again. Down the Jaffa road, down the meagre Hinnom valley, over the tents of the pilgrims, driven by the suddenly risen wind, pillars of dust went flying. Levi fell silent, trying to grasp whether the storm that was about to cover Yershalaim would bring any change in the fate of the unfortunate Yeshua. And straight away, looking at the threads of fire cutting up the cloud, he began to ask that lightning strike Yeshua's post. Repentantly looking into the clear sky that had not yet been devoured by the cloud, and where the vultures were veering on one wing to escape the storm, Levi thought he had been insanely hasty with his curses: now God was not going to listen to him. Turning his gaze to the foot of the hill, Levi fixed on the place where the strung-out cavalry regiment stood, and saw that considerable changes had taken place there. From above, Levi was able to distinguish very well the soldiers bustling about, pulling spears out of the ground, throwing cloaks on, the horse-handlers trotting towards the road leading black horses by their bridles. The regiment was moving off, that was clear. Spitting and shielding himself with his hand from the dust blowing in his face, Levi tried to grasp what it might mean if the cavalry was about to leave.",test,2,2,0,edges already seething white foam black smoky belly tinged yellow storm cloud growling threads fire fell road meagre valley tents pilgrims driven suddenly risen wind pillars dust went flying fell silent trying grasp whether storm cover would bring change fate unfortunate straight away looking threads fire cutting cloud began ask lightning strike post looking clear sky yet devoured cloud vultures veering one wing escape storm thought insanely hasty curses going listen gaze foot hill fixed place strungout cavalry regiment stood saw considerable changes taken place able distinguish well soldiers bustling pulling spears ground throwing cloaks horsehandlers trotting towards road leading black horses bridles regiment moving clear shielding hand dust blowing face tried grasp might mean cavalry leave
5968,"He shifted his gaze further up and made out a little figure in a crimson military chlamys climbing towards the place of execution. And here a chill came over the heart of the former tax collector in anticipation of the joyful end. The man climbing the mountain in the fifth hour of the robbers' sufferings was the commander of the cohort, who had come galloping from Yershalaim accompanied by an aide. At a gesture from Ratslayer, the file of soldiers parted, and the centurion saluted the tribune. The latter, taking Ratslayer aside, whispered something to him. The centurion saluted him a second time and moved towards the group of executioners, who were sitting on stones at the foot of the posts. The tribune meanwhile directed his steps towards the one sitting on the three-legged stool, and the seated man politely rose to meet the tribune. And the tribune said something to him in a low voice, and the two went over to the posts. They were joined by the head of the temple guard. Ratslayer, casting a squeamish sidelong glance at the dirty rags lying on the ground near the posts, rags that had recently been the criminals' clothing, and which the executioners had rejected, called two of them and ordered:  'Follow me!",test,2,2,0,shifted gaze made little figure crimson military chlamys climbing towards place execution chill came heart former tax collector anticipation joyful end man climbing mountain fifth hour robbers sufferings commander cohort come galloping accompanied aide gesture file soldiers parted centurion saluted tribune latter taking aside whispered something centurion saluted second time moved towards group executioners sitting stones foot posts tribune meanwhile directed steps towards one sitting threelegged stool seated man politely rose meet tribune tribune said something low voice two went posts joined head temple guard casting squeamish sidelong glance dirty rags lying ground near posts rags recently criminals clothing executioners rejected called two ordered
5969,"'  From the nearest post came a hoarse, senseless song. Gestas, hanging on it, had lost his mind from the flies and sun towards the end of the third hour, and was now quietly singing something about grapes, but his head, covered with a turban, occasionally swayed all the same, and then the flies rose sluggishly from his face and settled on it again. Dysmas, on the second post, suffered more than the other two because he did not lose consciousness, and he swung his head constantly and rhythmically, right and left, so that his ears struck his shoulders. Yeshua was more fortunate than the other two. In the very first hour, he began to have blackouts, and then he fell into oblivion, hanging his head in its unwound turban. The flies and horseflies therefore covered him completely, so that his face disappeared under the black swarming mass. In his groin, and on his belly, and in his armpits, fat horseflies sat sucking at his yellow naked body. Obeying the gestures of the man in the hood, one of the executioners took a spear and another brought a bucket and a sponge to the post. The first executioner raised the spear and with it tapped first one, then the other of Yeshua's arms, stretched out and bound with ropes to the crossbar of the post. The body, with its protruding ribs, gave a start.",test,2,2,0,nearest post came hoarse senseless song hanging lost mind flies sun towards end third hour quietly singing something grapes head covered turban occasionally swayed flies rose sluggishly face settled second post suffered two lose consciousness swung head constantly rhythmically right left ears struck shoulders fortunate two first hour began blackouts fell oblivion hanging head unwound turban flies horseflies therefore covered completely face disappeared black swarming mass groin belly armpits fat horseflies sat sucking yellow naked body gestures man hood one executioners took spear another brought bucket sponge post first executioner raised spear tapped first one arms stretched bound ropes crossbar post body protruding ribs gave start
5970,"The executioner passed the tip of the spear over the belly. Then Yeshua raised his head, and the flies moved off with a buzz, revealing the face of the hanged man, swollen with bites, the eyes puffy, an unrecognizable face. Ungluing his eyelids, Ha-Nozri looked down. His eyes, usually clear, were slightly clouded. 'Ha-Nozri! ' said the executioner. Ha-Nozri moved his swollen lips and answered in a hoarse robber's voice:  'What do you want? Why have you come to me? '  'Drink!

5971,"Joy flashed in his eyes, he clung to the sponge and began greedily imbibing the moisture. From the neighbouring post came the voice of Dysmas:  'Injustice! I'm a robber just like him! '  Dysmas strained but was unable to move, his arms being bound to the crossbar in three places with loops of rope. He drew in his belly, clawed the ends of the crossbar with his nails, kept his head turned towards Yeshua's post, malice blazed in the eyes of Dysmas. A dusty cloud covered the place, it became much darker. When the dust blew away, the centurion shouted:  'Silence on the second post! '  Dysmas fell silent. Yeshua tore himself away from the sponge, and trying to make his voice sound gentle and persuasive, but not succeeding, he begged the executioner hoarsely:  'Give him a drink.

5972,"The storm cloud had already poured across half the sky, aiming towards Yershalaim, boiling white clouds raced ahead of the storm cloud suffused with black moisture and fire. There was a flash and a thunderclap right over the hill. The executioner removed the sponge from the spear. 'Praise the magnanimous hegemon! ' he whispered solemnly, and gently pricked Yeshua in the heart. He twitched and whispered:  `Hegemon...'  Blood ran down his belly, his lower jaw twitched convulsively and his head dropped. At the second thunderclap, the executioner was already giving Dysmas a drink, and with the same words:  'Praise the hegemon! ' - killed him as well. Gestas, deprived of reason, cried out fearfully as soon as the executioner came near him, but when the sponge touched his lips, he growled something and seized it with his teeth.

5973,"The man in the hood followed the executioner and the centurion, and after him came the head of the temple guard. Stopping at the first post, the man in the hood examined the blood-covered Yeshua attentively, touched his foot with his white hand, and said to his companions:  'Dead. '  The same was repeated at the other two posts. After that the tribune motioned to the centurion and, turning, started off the hilltop together with the head of the temple guard and the man in the hood. Semi-darkness set in, and lightning farrowed the black sky. Fire suddenly sprayed out of it, and the centurion's shout:  'Raise the cordon! ', was drowned in rumbling. The happy soldiers rushed headlong down the hill, putting on their helmets. Darkness covered Yershalaim.

5974,"The deluge fell so terribly that the soldiers were already pursued by raging streams as they ran downhill. Soldiers slipped and fell in the sodden clay, hurrying to get to the level road, along which - now barely visible through the sheet of water - the thoroughly drenched cavalry was heading for Yershalaim. A few minutes later only one man remained in the smoky brew of storm, water and fire on the hill. Shaking the not uselessly stolen knife, falling from slippery ledges, clutching at whatever was there, sometimes crawling on his knees, he strained towards the posts. He now vanished in total darkness, now was suddenly illumined by a tremulous light. Having made his way to the posts, already up to his ankles in water, he tore off his heavy water-soaked tallith, remaining just in his shirt, and clung to Yeshua's feet. He cut the ropes on his shins, stepped up on the lower crossbar, embraced Yeshua and freed his arms from the upper bonds. The naked, wet body of Yeshua collapsed on Levi and brought him to the ground. Levi wanted to heave it on to his shoulders straight away, but some thought stopped him. He left the body with its thrown-back head and outspread arms on the ground in the water, and ran, his feet slithering apart in the clayey mire, to the other posts.",test,2,2,0,deluge fell terribly soldiers already pursued raging streams ran downhill slipped fell sodden clay hurrying get level road along barely visible sheet water thoroughly drenched cavalry heading minutes later one man remained smoky brew storm water fire hill uselessly stolen knife falling slippery ledges clutching whatever sometimes crawling knees strained towards posts vanished total darkness suddenly illumined tremulous light made way posts already ankles water tore heavy watersoaked tallith remaining shirt clung feet cut ropes shins stepped lower crossbar embraced freed arms upper bonds naked wet body collapsed brought ground wanted heave shoulders straight away thought stopped left body thrownback head outspread arms ground water ran feet slithering apart clayey mire posts
5975,"He cut the ropes on them as well, and the two bodies collapsed on the ground. Several minutes passed, and all that remained on the top of the hill was these two bodies and the three empty posts. Water beat on the bodies and rolled them over. By that time both Levi and the body of Yeshua were gone from the hilltop. CHAPTER 17  An Unquiet Day  On Friday morning, that is, the day after the accursed s�ance, all the available staff of the Variety - the bookkeeper Vassily Stepanovich Lastochkin, two accountants, three typists, both box-office girls, the messengers, ushers, cleaning women - in short, all those available, were not at their places doing their jobs, but were all sitting on the window-sills looking out on Sadovaya and watching what was going on by the wall of the Variety. By this wall a queue of many thousands clung in two rows, its tail reaching to Kudrinskaya Square. At the head of the line stood some two dozen scalpers well known to theatrical Moscow. The line behaved with much agitation, attracting the notice of the citizens streaming past, and was occupied with the discussion of inflammatory tales about yesterday's unprecedented s�ance of black magic. These same tales caused the greatest consternation in the bookkeeper Vassily Stepanovich, who had not been present at the previous evening's performance. The ushers told of God knows what, among other things that after the conclusion of the famous s�ance, some female citizens went running around in the street looking quite indecent, and so on in the same vein.",test,2,3,0,cut ropes well two bodies collapsed ground minutes passed remained top hill two bodies three empty posts beat bodies rolled time body gone hilltop morning day accursed s�ance available staff bookkeeper two accountants three typists boxoffice girls messengers ushers cleaning women short available places jobs sitting windowsills looking watching going wall wall queue many thousands clung two rows tail reaching head line stood two dozen scalpers well known theatrical line behaved much agitation attracting notice citizens streaming past occupied discussion inflammatory tales yesterdays unprecedented s�ance black magic tales caused greatest consternation bookkeeper present previous evenings performance ushers told knows among things conclusion famous s�ance female citizens went running around street looking quite indecent vein
5976,"The modest and quiet Vassily Stepanovich merely blinked his eyes, listening to the tall tales of these wonders, and decidedly did not know what to undertake, and yet something had to be undertaken, and precisely by him, because he now turned out to be the senior member of the whole Variety team. By ten o'clock the line of people desiring tickets had swelled so much that rumour of it reached the police, and with astonishing swiftness detachments were sent, both on foot and mounted, to bring this line into some sort of order. However, in itself even an orderly snake a half-mile long presented a great temptation, and caused utter amazement in the citizens on Sadovaya. That was outside, but inside the Variety things were also none too great. Early in the morning the telephones began to ring and went on ringing without interruption in Likhodeev's office, in Rimsky's office, at the bookkeeper's, in the box office, and in Varenukha's office. Vassily Stepanovich at first made some answer, the box-office girl also answered, the ushers mumbled something into the telephones, but then they stopped altogether, because to questions of where Likhodeev, Varenukha and Rimsky were, there was decidedly no answer. At first they tried to get off by saying  'Likhodeev's at home', but the reply to this was that they had called him at home, and at home they said Likhodeev was at the Variety. An agitated lady called, started asking for Rimsky, was advised to call his wife, to which the receiver, sobbing, answered that she was his wife and that Rimsky was nowhere to be found. Some sort of nonsense was beginning. The cleaning woman had already told everybody that when she came to the findirector's office to clean, she saw the door wide open, the lights on, the window to the garden broken, the armchair lying on the floor, and no one in the office.",test,2,3,0,modest quiet merely blinked eyes listening tall tales wonders decidedly know undertake yet something undertaken precisely turned senior member whole team ten oclock line people desiring tickets swelled much rumour reached police astonishing swiftness detachments sent foot mounted bring line sort order even orderly snake halfmile long presented great temptation caused utter amazement citizens outside inside things also none great morning telephones began ring went ringing without interruption office office bookkeepers box office office first made answer boxoffice girl also answered ushers mumbled something telephones stopped altogether questions decidedly answer first tried get saying home reply called home home said agitated lady called started asking advised call wife receiver sobbing answered wife nowhere found sort nonsense beginning cleaning woman already told everybody came findirectors office clean saw door wide open lights window garden broken armchair lying floor one office
5977,"Shortly after ten o'clock, Madame Rimsky burst into the Variety. She was sobbing and wringing her hands. Vassily Stepanovich was utterly at a loss and did not know how to counsel her. Then at half past ten came the police. Their first and perfectly reasonable question was:  ""What's going on here, citizens? What's this all about? '  The team stepped back, bringing forward the pale and agitated Vassily Stepanovich. He had to call things by their names and confess that the administration of the Variety in the persons of the director, the findirector and the administrator had vanished and no one knew where, that the master of ceremonies had been taken to a psychiatric hospital after yesterday's s�ance, and that, to put it briefly, this seance yesterday had frankly been a scandalous s�ance. The sobbing Madame Rimsky, having been calmed down as much as possible, was sent home, and the greatest interest was shown in the cleaning woman's story about the shape in which the findirector's office had been found. The staff were asked to go to their places and get busy, and in a short while the investigation appeared in the Variety building, accompanied by a sharp-eared, muscular, ash-coloured dog with extremely intelligent eyes.",test,2,2,0,ten oclock burst sobbing wringing hands utterly loss know counsel half past ten came police first perfectly reasonable question going citizens team stepped back bringing forward pale agitated call things names confess administration persons director findirector administrator vanished one knew master ceremonies taken psychiatric hospital yesterdays s�ance put briefly seance yesterday frankly scandalous s�ance sobbing calmed much possible sent home greatest interest shown cleaning womans story shape findirectors office found staff asked go places get busy short investigation appeared building accompanied sharpeared muscular ashcoloured dog extremely intelligent eyes
5978,"The whisper spread at once among the Variety staff that the dog was none other than the famous Ace of Diamonds. And so it was. His behaviour amazed them all. The moment Ace of Diamonds ran into the findirector's office, he growled, baring his monstrous yellow fangs, then crouched on his belly and, with some sort of look of anguish and at the same time of rage in his eyes, crawled towards the broken window. Overcoming his fear, he suddenly jumped up on the window-sill and, throwing back his sharp muzzle, howled savagely and angrily. He refused to leave the window, growled and twitched, and kept trying to jump out. The dog was taken from the office and turned loose in the lobby, whence he walked out through the main entrance to the street and led those following him to the cab stand. There he lost the trail he had been pursuing. After that Ace of Diamonds was taken away. The investigation settled in Varenukha's office, where they began summoning in turn all the Variety staff members who had witnessed yesterday's events during the s�ance.",test,2,2,0,whisper spread among staff dog none famous behaviour amazed moment ran findirectors office growled baring monstrous yellow fangs crouched belly sort look anguish time rage eyes crawled towards broken window fear suddenly jumped windowsill throwing back sharp muzzle howled savagely angrily refused leave window growled twitched kept trying jump dog taken office turned loose lobby whence walked main entrance street led following cab stand lost trail pursuing taken away investigation settled office began summoning turn staff members witnessed yesterdays events s�ance
5979,"It must be said that the investigation had at every step to overcome unforeseen difficulties. The thread kept snapping off in their hands. There had been posters, right? Right. But during the night they had been pasted over with new ones, and now, strike me dead, there wasn't a single one to be found! And the magician himself, where had he come from? Ah, who knows!

And indeed no trace of the contract was found in the files of the bookkeeping office, nor at the findirector's, nor at Likhodeev's or Varenukha's. And what was this magician's name? Vassily Stepanovich did not know, he had not been at the s�ance yesterday. The ushers did not know, the box-office girl wrinkled her brow, wrinkled it, thought and thought, and finally said:  'Wo... Woland, seems like...'  Or maybe not Woland? Maybe not Woland. Maybe Faland.

Likhodeev himself was not there either. The housekeeper Grunya was not there, and where she had gone nobody knew. The chairman of the management, Nikanor Ivanovich, was not there, Bedsornev was not there! Something utterly preposterous was coming out: the whole top administration had vanished, a strange, scandalous seance had taken place the day before, but who had produced it and at whose prompting, no one knew. And meanwhile it was drawing towards noon, when the box office was to open. But, of course, there could be no talk of that! A huge piece of cardboard was straight away posted on the doors of the Variety reading:  'Today's Show Cancelled'.

5982,"The investigation departed to continue its work elsewhere, the staff was sent home, leaving only the watchmen, and the doors of the Variety were locked. The bookkeeper Vassily Stepanovich had urgently to perform two tasks. First, to go to the Commission on Spectacles and Entertainment of the Lighter Type with a report on yesterday's events and, second, to visit the Finspectacle sector so as to turn over yesterday's receipts - 21,711 roubles. The precise and efficient Vassily Stepanovich wrapped the money in newspaper, criss-crossed it with string, put it in his briefcase, and, knowing his instructions very well, set out, of course, not for a bus or a tram, but for the cab stand. The moment the drivers of the three cabs saw a passenger hurrying towards the stand with a tightly stuffed briefcase, all three left empty right under his nose, looking back at him angrily for some reason. Struck by this circumstance, the bookkeeper stood like a post for a long time, trying to grasp what it might mean. About three minutes later, an empty cab drove up, but the driver's face twisted the moment he saw the passenger. 'Are you free? ' Vassily Stepanovich asked with a cough of surprise. 'Show your money,' the driver replied angrily, without looking at the passenger.",test,2,2,0,investigation departed continue work elsewhere staff sent home leaving watchmen doors locked bookkeeper urgently perform two tasks go report yesterdays events second visit sector turn yesterdays receipts roubles precise efficient wrapped money newspaper crisscrossed string put briefcase knowing instructions well set course bus tram cab stand moment drivers three cabs saw passenger hurrying towards stand tightly stuffed briefcase three left empty right nose looking back angrily reason circumstance bookkeeper stood like post long time trying grasp might mean three minutes later empty cab drove drivers face twisted moment saw passenger free asked cough surprise money driver replied angrily without looking passenger
5983,"With increasing amazement, the bookkeeper, pressing the precious briefcase under his arm, pulled a ten-rouble bill from his wallet and showed it to the driver. 'I won't go!

'  The completely bewildered bookkeeper took two three-rouble bills from his wallet and showed them to the driver.

Having got where he had to go, having paid satisfactorily, the bookkeeper entered the building and went down the corridor towards the manager's office, and realized on his way that he had come at the wrong time.

5986,"'Nothing, nothing, nothing, my dears! ' she shouted, addressing no one knew whom. The jacket and trousers are there, but inside the jacket there's nothing! '  She disappeared through some door, and straight away from behind it came the noise of smashing dishes. The manager of the commission's first sector, whom the bookkeeper knew, ran out of the secretary's room, but he was in such a state that he did not recognize the bookkeeper and disappeared without a trace. Shaken by all this, the bookkeeper reached the secretary's room, which was the anteroom to the office of the chairman of the commission, and here he was definitively dumbfounded. From behind the closed door of the office came a terrible voice, undoubtedly belonging to Prokhor Petrovich, the chairman of the commission. `Must be scolding somebody! ' the consternated bookkeeper thought and, looking around, saw something else: in a leather armchair, her head thrown back, sobbing unrestrainedly, a wet handkerchief in her hand, legs stretched out into the middle of the room, lay Prokhor Petrovich's personal secretary - the beautiful Anna Richardovna. Anna Richardovna's chin was all smeared with lipstick, and down her peachy cheeks black streams of sodden mascara flowed from her eyelashes.",test,2,2,0,nothing nothing dears shouted addressing one knew jacket trousers inside jacket theres nothing disappeared door straight away behind came noise smashing dishes manager commissions first sector bookkeeper knew ran secretarys room state recognize bookkeeper disappeared without trace bookkeeper reached secretarys room anteroom office chairman commission definitively dumbfounded behind closed door office came terrible voice undoubtedly belonging chairman commission scolding somebody consternated bookkeeper thought looking around saw something else leather armchair head thrown back sobbing unrestrainedly wet handkerchief hand legs stretched middle room lay personal secretary beautiful chin smeared lipstick peachy cheeks black streams sodden mascara flowed eyelashes
5987,"Seeing someone come in, Anna Richardovna jumped up, rushed to the bookkeeper, clutched the lapels of his jacket, began shaking him and shouting:  'Thank God! At least one brave man has been found! Everybody ran away, everybody betrayed us! Let's go, let's go to him, I don't know what to do! ' And, still sobbing, she dragged the bookkeeper into the office. Once in the office, the bookkeeper first of all dropped his briefcase, and all the thoughts in his head turned upside-down. And, it must be said, not without reason. At a huge writing desk with a massive inkstand an empty suit sat and with a dry pen, not dipped in ink, traced on a piece of paper. The suit was wearing a necktie, a fountain pen stuck from its pocket, but above the collar there was neither neck nor head, just as there were no hands sticking out of the sleeves.

Into the secretary's room, with calm, business-like strides, marched the police, to the number of two men. Seeing them, the beauty sobbed still harder, jabbing towards the door of the office with her hand. 'Let's not cry now, citizeness,' the first said calmly, and the bookkeeper, feeling himself quite superfluous there, ran out of the secretary's room and a minute later was already in the fresh air. There was some sort of draught in his head, a soughing as in a chimney, and through this soughing he heard scraps of the stories the ushers told about yesterday's cat, who had taken part in the s�ance.

5994,"The affiliate for city spectacles was housed in a peeling old mansion set back from the street, and was famous for the porphyry columns in its vestibule. But it was not the columns that struck visitors to the affiliate that day, but what was going on at the foot of them. Several visitors stood in stupefaction and stared at a weeping girl sitting behind a small table on which lay special literature about various spectacles, which the girl sold. At that moment, the girl was not offering any of this literature to anyone, and only waved her hand at sympathetic inquiries, while at the same time, from above, from below, from the sides, and from all sections of the affiliate poured the ringing of at least twenty overwrought telephones. After weeping for a while, the girl suddenly gave a start and cried out hysterically:  'Here it comes again! ' and unexpectedly began singing in a tremulous soprano:  'Glorious sea, sacred Baikal...'[1]  A messenger appeared on the stairs, shook his fist at someone, and began singing along with the girl in a dull, weak-voiced baritone:  'Glorious boat, a barrel of cisco ...'[2]  The messenger's voice was joined by distant voices, the choir began to swell, and finally the song resounded in all corners of the affiliate.

5995,"Tears flowed down the girl's face, she tried to clench her teeth, but her mouth opened of itself, as she sang an octave higher than the messenger:  'This young lad's ready to frisk-o! '  What struck the silent visitors to the affiliate was that the choristers, scattered in various places, sang quite harmoniously, as if the whole choir stood there with its eyes fixed on some invisible director. Passers-by in Vagankovsky Lane stopped by the fence of the yard, wondering at the gaiety that reigned in the affiliate. As soon as the first verse came to an end, the singing suddenly ceased, again as if to a director's baton. The messenger quietly swore and disappeared. Here the front door opened, and in it appeared a citizen in a summer jacket, from under which protruded the skirts of a white coat, and with him a policeman. 'Take measures, doctor, I implore you! ' the girl cried hysterically. The secretary of the affiliate ran out to the stairs and, obviously burning with shame and embarrassment, began falteringly:  'You see, doctor, we have a case of some sort of mass hypnosis, and so it's necessary that...' He did not finish the sentence, began to choke on his words, and suddenly sang out in a tenor:  'Shilka and Nerchinsk ...'[4]  'Fool!

'  The moment the verse ended, the girl was the first to receive a dose of valerian from the doctor, who then ran after the secretary to give the others theirs.

5997,"It turned out that the manager of the city affiliate, 'who has made a perfect mess of lightened entertainment' (the girl's words),suffered from a mania for organizing all sorts of little clubs. 'Blew smoke in the authorities' eyes! ' screamed the girl. In the course of a year this manager had succeeded in organizing a club of Lermontov studies [5], of chess and checkers, of ping-pong, and of horseback riding. For the summer, he was threatening to organize clubs of fresh-water canoeing and alpinism. And so today, during lunch-break, this manager comes in ...  ' ...with some son of a bitch on his arm,' the girl went on, 'hailing from nobody knows where, in wretched checkered trousers, a cracked pince-nez, and ... with a completely impossible mug! ...'  And straight away, the girl said, he recommended him to all those eating in the affiliate's dining room as a prominent specialist in organizing choral-singing clubs. The faces of the future alpinists darkened, but the manager immediately called on everyone to cheer up, while the specialist joked a little, laughed a little, and swore an oath that singing takes no time at all, but that, incidentally, there was a whole load of benefits to be derived from it. Well, of course, as the girl said, the first to pop up were Fanov and Kosarchuk, well-known affiliate toadies, who announced that they would sign up.

5998,"They decided to sing during the lunch break, since the rest of the time was taken up by Lermontov and checkers. The manager, to set an example, declared that he was a tenor, and everything after that went as in a bad dream. The checkered specialist-choirmaster bawled out:  'Do, mi, sol, do! ' - dragged the most bashful from behind the bookcases, where they had tried to save themselves from singing, told Kosarchuk he had perfect pitch, began whining, squealing, begging them to be kind to an old singing-master, tapped the tuning fork on his knuckle, beseeched them to strike up  'Glorious Sea'. Strike up they did. And gloriously. The checkered one really knew his business. They finished the first verse. Here the director excused himself, said: `Back in a minute...', and disappeared.

A quarter of an hour later, three trucks drove up to the fence in Vagankovsky, and the entire staff of the affiliate, the manager at its head, was loaded on to them. As soon as the first truck, after lurching in the gateway, drove out into the lane, the staff members, who were standing on the platform holding each other's shoulders, opened their mouths, and the whole lane resounded with the popular song. The second truck picked it up, then the third. And so they drove on. Passers-by hurrying about their own business would cast only a fleeting glance at the trucks, not surprised in the least, thinking it was a group excursion to the country. And they were indeed going to the country, though not on an excursion, but to Professor Stravinsky's clinic.

6001,"Having learned from experience by now, he first peeked cautiously into the oblong hall where, behind frosted-glass windows with gold lettering, the staff was sitting. Here the bookkeeper discovered no signs of alarm or scandal. It was quiet, as it ought to be in a decent institution. Vassily Stepanovich stuck his head through the window with  'Cash Deposits' written over it, greeted some unfamiliar clerk, and politely asked for a deposit slip. 'What do you need it for? ' the clerk in the window asked. The bookkeeper was amazed. 'I want to turn over some cash. I'm from the Variety.

6002,"'Strange! ...' thought the bookkeeper. His amazement was perfectly natural. It was the first time in his life that he had met with such a circumstance. Everybody knows how hard it is to get money; obstacles to it can always be found. But there had been no case in the bookkeeper's thirty years of experience when anyone, either an official or a private person, had had a hard time accepting money. But at last the little grille moved aside, and the bookkeeper again leaned to the window. 'Do you have a lot? ' the clerk asked.

6003,"'  'Oho! ' the clerk answered ironically for some reason and handed the bookkeeper a green slip. Knowing the form well, the bookkeeper instantly filled it out and began to untie the string on the bundle. When he unpacked his load, everything swam before his eyes, he murmured something painfully. Foreign money flitted before his eyes: there were stacks of Canadian dollars, British pounds, Dutch guldens, Latvian lats, Estonian kroons...  'There he is, one of those tricksters from the Variety!

6004,"The reason for Maximilian Andreevich's coming to Moscow was a telegram received late in the evening two days before with the following content:  Have just been run over by tram-car at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three pm come. Berlioz. Maximilian Andreevich was considered one of the most intelligent men in Kiev, and deservedly so. But even the most intelligent man might have been nonplussed by such a telegram. If someone sends a telegram saying he has been run over, it is clear that he has not died of it. But then, what was this about a funeral? Or was he in a bad way and foreseeing death? That was possible, but such precision was in the highest degree strange: how could he know he would be buried on Friday at three pm? An astonishing telegram!

6005,"Very simple. A mistake had been made, and the message had been distorted. The word 'have' had undoubtedly come there from some other telegram in place of the word  'Berlioz', which got moved and wound up at the end of the telegram. With such an emendation, the meaning of the telegram became clear, though, of course, tragic. When the outburst of grief that struck Maximilian Andreevich's wife subsided, he at once started preparing to go to Moscow. One secret about Maximilian Andreevich ought to be revealed. There is no arguing that he felt sorry for his wife's nephew, who had died in the bloom of life. But, of course, being a practical man, he realized that there was no special need for his presence at the funeral. And nevertheless Maximilian Andreevich was in great haste to go to Moscow.

6006,"The point was the apartment. An apartment in Moscow is a serious thing! For some unknown reason, Maximilian Andreevich did not like Kiev [1], and the thought of moving to Moscow had been gnawing at him so much lately that he had even begun to sleep badly. He did not rejoice in the spring flooding of the Dnieper, when, overflowing the islands by the lower bank, the water merged with the horizon. He did not rejoice in the staggeringly beautiful view which opened out from the foot of the monument to Prince Vladimir. He did not take delight in patches of sunlight playing in springtime on the brick paths of Vladimir's Hill. He wanted none of it, he wanted only one thing - to move to Moscow. Advertising in the newspapers about exchanging an apartment on Institutsky Street in Kiev for smaller quarters in Moscow brought no results. No takers were found, or if they occasionally were, their offers were disingenuous. The telegram staggered Maximilian Andreevich.",test,2,2,0,point apartment apartment serious thing unknown reason like thought moving gnawing much lately even begun sleep badly rejoice spring flooding overflowing islands lower bank water merged horizon rejoice staggeringly beautiful view opened foot monument take delight patches sunlight playing springtime brick paths wanted none wanted one thing move newspapers exchanging apartment smaller quarters brought results takers found occasionally offers disingenuous telegram staggered
6007,"This was a moment it would be sinful to let slip. Practical people know that such moments do not come twice. In short, despite all obstacles, he had to succeed in inheriting his nephew's apartment on Sadovaya. Yes, it was difficult, very difficult, but these difficulties had to be overcome at whatever cost. The experienced Maximilian Andreevich knew that the first and necessary step towards that had to be the following: he must get himself registered, at least temporarily, as the tenant of his late nephew's three rooms. On Friday afternoon, Maximilian Andreevich walked through the door of the room which housed the management of no. 502-bis on Sadovava Street in Moscow. In the narrow room, with an old poster hanging on the wall illustrating in several pictures the ways of resuscitating people who have drowned in the river, an unshaven, middle-aged man with anxious eyes sat in perfect solitude at a wooden table. 'May I see the chairman? ' the industrial economist inquired politely, taking off his hat and putting his suitcase on a vacant chair.",test,2,2,0,moment would sinful let slip people know moments come twice short despite obstacles succeed inheriting nephews apartment difficult difficult difficulties overcome whatever cost experienced knew first necessary step towards following must get registered least temporarily tenant late nephews three rooms afternoon walked door room housed management narrow room old poster hanging wall illustrating several pictures ways resuscitating people drowned river unshaven middleaged man anxious eyes sat perfect solitude wooden table see chairman industrial economist inquired politely taking hat putting suitcase vacant chair

Looking sideways in anxiety, he muttered unintelligibly that the chairman was not there. `Is he at home? ' asked Poplavsky. `I've come on the most urgent business.

'Aha! ...' Poplavsky said to himself. `But surely there's somebody in the management? '  'Me,' the man responded in a weak voice. 'You see,' Poplavsky began to speak imposingly, 'I am the sole heir of the late Berlioz, my nephew, who, as you know, died at the Patriarch's Ponds, and I am obliged, in accordance with the law, to take over the inheritance contained in our apartment no. 50...'  'I'm not informed, comrade ...' the man interrupted in anguish. 'But, excuse me,' Poplavsky said in a sonorous voice, 'you are a member of the management and are obliged ...'

6010,"'Yes,' the latter said, barely audibly. The entering one whispered something to the seated one, and he, thoroughly upset, rose from his chair, and a few seconds later Poplavsky found himself alone in the empty management room. 'Eh, what a complication! As if on purpose, all of them at once ...' Poplavsky thought in vexation, crossing the asphalt courtyard and hurrying to apartment no. 50. As soon as the industrial economist rang, the door was opened, and Maximilian Andreevich entered the semi-dark front hall. It was a somewhat surprising circumstance that he could not figure out who had let him in: there was no one in the front hall except an enormous black cat sitting on a chair. Maximilian Andreevich coughed, stamped his feet, and then the door of the study opened and Koroviev came out to the front hall. Maximilian Andreevich bowed politely, but with dignity, and said:  'My name is Poplavsky. I am the uncle...'  But before he could finish, Koroviev snatched a dirty handkerchief from his pocket, buried his nose in it, and began to weep.",test,2,2,0,latter said barely audibly entering one whispered something seated one thoroughly upset rose chair seconds later found alone empty management room complication purpose thought vexation crossing asphalt courtyard hurrying apartment soon industrial economist rang door opened entered semidark front hall somewhat surprising circumstance could figure let one front hall except enormous black cat sitting chair coughed stamped feet door study opened came front hall bowed politely dignity said name uncle could finish snatched dirty handkerchief pocket buried nose began weep

' Here he was shaken with tears and began to exclaim: 'Such a calamity, eh? What's going on here, eh? '  'Run over by a tram-car? ' Poplavsky asked in a whisper. 'Clean!

' And, obviously unable to control himself, Koroviev pecked the wall beside the mirror with his nose and began to shake with sobs. Berlioz's uncle was genuinely struck by the stranger's behaviour.

6013,"However, at the same time, an unpleasant little cloud came over his soul, and straight away the snake-like thought flashed in him that this warm-hearted man might perchance have registered himself in the deceased man's apartment, for such examples have been known in this life. 'Forgive me, were you a friend of my late Misha? ' he asked, wiping his dry left eye with his sleeve, and with his right eye studying the racked-with-grief Koroviev. But the man was sobbing so much that one could understand nothing except the repeated word 'crunch! '  Having sobbed his fill, Koroviev finally unglued himself from the wall and said:  'No, I can't take any more! I'll go and swallow three hundred drops of tincture of valerian...' And turning his completely tear-bathed face to Poplavsky, he added: That's trams for you! '  'Pardon me, but did you send me the telegram?

'No, it's too much, I just can't,' Koroviev went on, snuffing his nose, 'when I remember: the wheel over the leg ... the wheel alone weighs three hundred pounds ... Crunch! ...  I'll go to bed, forget myself in sleep. ' And here he disappeared from the hall. The cat then stirred, jumped off the chair, stood on his hind legs, front legs akimbo, opened his maw and said:  'Well, so I sent the telegram. What of it? '  Maximilian Andreevich's head at once began to spin, his arms and legs went numb, he dropped the suitcase and sat down on a chair facing the cat. 'I believe I asked in good Russian?

6015,"'  But Poplavsky made no reply. 'Passport! '[2] barked the cat, holding out a plump paw. Understanding nothing and seeing nothing except the two sparks burning in the cat's eyes, Poplavsky snatched the passport from his pocket like a dagger. The cat picked up a pair of glasses in thick black frames from the pier-glass table, put them on his muzzle, thus acquiring a still more imposing air, and took the passport from Poplavsky's twitching hand. 'I wonder, am I going to faint or not? ...' thought Poplavsky. From far away came Koroviev's snivelling, the whole front hall filled with the smell of ether, valerian and some other nauseating vileness. 'What office issued this document?

I know that office, they issue passports to anybody. Whereas I, for instance, wouldn't issue one to the likes of you! Not on your life I wouldn't! I'd just take one look at your face and instantly refuse!

'  At his call a small man ran out to the front hall, limping, sheathed in black tights, with a knife tucked into his leather belt, red-haired, with a yellow fang and with albugo in his left eye. Poplavsky felt he could not get enough air, rose from his seat and backed away, clutching his heart. 'See him off, Azazello! ' the cat ordered and left the hall. 'Poplavsky,' the other twanged softly, 'I hope everything's understood now? '  Poplavsky nodded. 'Return immediately to Kiev,' Azazello went on.

6018,"'  This small man, who drove Poplavsky to mortal terror with his fang, knife and blind eye, only came up to the economist's shoulder, but his actions were energetic, precise and efficient. First of all, he picked up the passport and handed it to Maximilian Andreevich, and the latter took the booklet with a dead hand. Then the one named Azazello picked up the suitcase with one hand, with the other flung open the door, and, taking Berlioz's uncle under the arm, led him out to the landing of the stairway. Poplavsky leaned against the wall. Without any key, Azazello opened the suitcase, took out of it a huge roast chicken with a missing leg wrapped in greasy newspaper, and placed it on the landing. Then he took out two pairs of underwear, a razor-strop, some book and a case, and shoved it all down the stairwell with his foot, except for the chicken. The emptied suitcase went the same way. There came a crash from below and, judging by the sound of it, the lid broke off. Then the red-haired bandit grabbed the chicken by the leg, and with this whole chicken hit Poplavsky on the neck, flat, hard, and so terribly that the body of the chicken tore off and the leg remained in Azazello's hand.

6019,"Precisely so he might have said on this occasion. Yes, everything was confusion in Poplavsky's eyes. A long spark flew before his eyes, then gave place to some funereal snake that momentarily extinguished the May day, and Poplavsky went hurtling down the stairs, clutching his passport in his hand. Reaching the turn, he smashed the window on the landing with his foot and sat on a step. The legless chicken went bouncing past him and fell down the stairwell. Azazello, who stayed upstairs, instantly gnawed the chicken leg dean, stuck the bone into the side pocket of his tights, went back to the apartment, and shut the door behind him with a bang. At that moment there began to be heard from below the cautious steps of someone coming up. Having run down one more flight of stairs, Poplavsky sat on a wooden bench on the landing and caught his breath. Some tiny elderly man with an extraordinarily melancholy face, in an old-fashioned tussore silk suit and a hard straw hat with a green band, on his way upstairs, stopped beside Poplavsky.

6020,"50 is? '  'Further up,' Poplavsky replied curtly. 'I humbly thank you, citizen,' the little man said with the same sadness and went on up, while Poplavsky got to his feet and ran down. The question arises whether it might have been the police that Maximilian Andreevich was hastening to, to complain about the bandits who had perpetrated savage violence upon him in broad daylight? No, by no means, that can be said with certainty. To go into a police station and tell them, look here, just now a cat in eyeglasses read my passport, and then a man in tights, with a knife ... no, citizens, Maximilian Andreevich was indeed an intelligent man. He was already downstairs and saw just by the exit a door leading to some closet. The glass in the door was broken.

6021,"Poplavsky was even surprised himself at how little this upset him. He was occupied with another interesting and tempting thought: of testing the accursed apartment one more time on this little man. In fact, since he had inquired after its whereabouts, it meant he was going there for the first time. Therefore he was presently heading straight into the clutches of the company that had ensconced itself in apartment no. 50. Something told Poplavsky that the little man would be leaving this apartment very soon. Maximilian Andreevich was, of course, no longer going to any funeral of any nephew, and there was plenty of time before the train to Kiev. The economist looked around and ducked into the closet.

6022,"The closet was cool, it smelled of mice and boots. Maximilian Andreevich settled on some stump of wood and decided to wait. The position was convenient, from the closet one looked directly on to the exit from the sixth stairway. However, the man from Kiev had to wait longer than he supposed.

This ear caught a woman's laughter. Quick and brisk steps coming down. And now a woman's back flashed by. This woman, carrying a green oilcloth bag, went out through the front hall to the courtyard.

6025,"Crossing himself and muttering something, the melancholy little man rushed past him, hatless, with a completely crazed face, his bald head all scratched and his trousers completely wet. He began tearing at the handle of the front door, unable in his fear to determine whether it opened out or in, managed at last, and flew out into the sun in the courtyard. The testing of the apartment had been performed. Thinking no more either of the deceased nephew or of the apartment, shuddering at the thought of the risk he had been running, Maximilian Andreevich, whispering only the three words  'It's all clear, it's all clear! ', ran out to the courtyard. A few minutes later the bus was carrying the industrial economist in the direction of the Kiev station. As for the tiny little man, a most unpleasant story had gone on with him while the economist was sitting in the closet downstairs. The little man was barman at the Variety, and was called Andrei Foldch Sokov. While the investigation was going on in the Variety, Andrei Fokich kept himself apart from all that was happening, and only one thing could be noticed, that he became still sadder than he generally was, and, besides, that he inquired of the messenger Karpov where the visiting magician was staying.

6026,"50. The door was opened for him immediately, but the barman gave a start, backed away, and did not enter at once. This was understandable. The door had been opened by a girl who was wearing nothing but a coquettish little lacy apron and a white fichu on her head. On her feet, however, she had golden slippers. The girl was distinguished by an irreproachable figure, and the only thing that might have been considered a defect in her appearance was the purple scar on her neck. 'Well, come in then, since you rang,' said the girl, fixing her lewd green eyes on the barman. Andrei Fokich gasped, blinked his eyes, and stepped into the front hall, taking off his hat. Just then the telephone in the front hall rang.

'  And to save himself from the nasty thing, he began casting sidelong glances around him. The whole big and semi-dark hall was cluttered with unusual objects and clothing. Thus, thrown over the back of a chair was a funereal cloak lined with fiery cloth, on the pier-glass table lay a long sword with a gleaming gold hilt. Three swords with silver hilts stood in the corner like mere umbrellas or canes. And on the stag-horns hung berets with eagle feathers. `Yes,' the maid was saying into the telephone. 'How's that?

'  'Let him come in,' Koroviev's cracked voice came from the study. 'Go into the living room,' the girl said as simply as if she were dressed like anyone else, opened the door to the living room, and herself left the hall. Going in where he was invited, the barman even forgot his business, so greatly was he struck by the decor of the room. Through the stained glass of the big windows (a fantasy of the jeweller's utterly vanished wife) poured an unusual, church-like light. Logs were blazing in the huge antique fireplace, despite the hot spring day. And yet it was not the least bit hot in the room, and even quite the contrary, on entering one was enveloped in some sort of dankness as in a cellar.

6030,"There was a table at the sight of which the God-fearing barman gave a start: the table was covered with church brocade. On the brocade tablecloth stood a host of bottles - round-bellied, mouldy and dusty. Among the bottles gleamed a dish, and it was obvious at once that it was of pure gold. At the fireplace a small red-haired fellow with a knife in his belt was roasting pieces of meat on a long steel sword, and the juice dripped into the fire, and the smoke went up the flue. There was a smell not only of roasting meat, but also of some very strong perfume and incense, and it flashed in the barman's mind, for he already knew of Berlioz's death and his place of residence from the newspapers, that this might, for all he knew, be a church panikhida [4] that was being served for Berlioz, which thought, however, he drove away at once as a priori absurd. The astounded barman unexpectedly heard a heavy bass:  'Well, sir, what can I do for you? '  And here the barman discovered in the shadows the one he wanted. The black magician was sprawled on some boundless sofa, low, with pillows scattered over it. As it seemed to the barman, the artiste was wearing only black underwear and black pointed shoes. 'I,' the barman began bitterly, 'am the manager of the buffet at the Variety Theatre...'

6034,"The barman managed to say:  'I humbly thank you,' and lowered himself on to the stool. Its back leg broke at once with a crack, and the barman, gasping, struck his backside most painfully on the floor. As he fell, he kicked another stool in front of him with his foot, and from it spilled a full cup of red wine on his trousers. The artiste exclaimed:  'Oh! Are you hurt? '  Azazello helped the barman up and gave him another seat. In a voice filled with grief, the barman declined his host's suggestion that he take off his trousers and dry them before the fire, and, feeling unbearably uncomfortable in his wet underwear and clothing, cautiously sat down on the other stool.

In the crimson light of the fireplace a sword flashed in front of the barman, and Azazello laid a sizzling piece of meat on the golden dish, squeezed lemon juice over it, and handed the barman a golden two-pronged fork. 'My humble... I ...'  'No, no, try it! '  The barman put a piece into his mouth out of politeness, and understood at once that he was chewing something very fresh indeed, and, above all, extraordinarily delicious. But as he was chewing the fragrant, juicy meat, the barman nearly choked and fell a second time. From the neighbouring room a big, dark bird flew in and gently brushed the barman's bald head with its wing. Alighting on the mantelpiece beside the clock, the bird turned out to be an owl.

Straight away Koroviev came bounding from the study, clutched the barman's hand, and began shaking it, begging Andrei Fokich to give his regards to everybody, everybody.

He took it off and, jumping from fear, cried out softly: in his hands was a velvet beret with a dishevelled cock's feather. The barman crossed himself. At the same moment, the beret miaowed, turned into a black kitten and, springing back on to Andrei Fokich's head, sank all its claws into his bald spot.

6047,"What happened to him afterwards is known perfectly well. Running out the gateway, the barman looked around wildly, as if searching for something. A minute later he was on the other side of the street in a pharmacy. He had no sooner uttered the words:  'Tell me, please ...' when the woman behind the counter exclaimed:  'Citizen, your head is cut all over! '  Some five minutes later the barman was bandaged with gauze, knew that the best specialists in liver diseases were considered to be professors Bernadsky and Kuzmin, asked who was closer, lit up with joy on learning that Kuzmin lived literally across the courtyard in a small white house, and some two minutes later was in that house. The premises were antiquated but very, very cosy. The barman remembered that the first one he happened to meet was an old nurse who wanted to take his hat, but as he turned out to have no hat, the nurse went off somewhere, munching with an empty mouth. Instead of her, there turned up near the mirror and under what seemed some sort of arch, a middle-aged woman who said straight away that it was possible to make an appointment only for the nineteenth, not before. The barman at once grasped what would save him. Peering with fading eyes through the arch, where three persons were waiting in what was obviously some sort of anteroom, he whispered:  'Mortally ill...'

6048,"At that same moment the opposite door opened, there was the flash of a gold pince-nez. The woman in the white coat said:  'Citizens, this patient will go out of turn. '  And before the barman could look around him, he was in Professor Kuzmin's office. There was nothing terrible, solemn or medical in this oblong room. ""What's wrong with you? ' Professor Kuzmin asked in a pleasant voice, and glanced with some alarm at the bandaged head. `I've just learned from reliable hands,' the barman replied, casting wild glances at some group photograph under glass, 'that I'm going to die of liver cancer in February of this corning year. I beg you to stop it.

He asked:  'Do you drink vodka? '  'Never touch it,' the barman answered. A moment later he was undressed, lying on the cold oilcloth of the couch, and the professor was kneading his stomach. Here, it must be said, the barman cheered up considerably. The professor categorically maintained that presently, at least for the given moment, the barman had no symptoms of cancer, but since it was so ... since he was afraid and had been frightened by some charlatan, he must perform all the tests ... The professor was scribbling away on some sheets of paper, explaining where to go, what to bring.

The barman took out thirty roubles and placed them on the table, and then, with an unexpected softness, as if operating with a cat's paw, he placed on top of the bills a clinking stack wrapped in newspaper. 'And what is this? ' Kuzmin asked, twirling his moustache. 'Don't scorn it, citizen Professor,' the barman whispered. 'I beg you - stop the cancer!

'Not in anything,' ordered Kuzmin. 'Ahh! ...' the barman exclaimed wistfully, gazing at the professor with tenderness, gathering up his gold pieces and backing towards the door. That evening the professor had few patients, and as twilight approached the last one left.

Could it be the prescription for the urine analysis? Oh-oh! ...  He's stolen my overcoat! ' And the professor rushed for the front hall, one arm still in the sleeve of his white coat.

6054,"' The coats all turned out to be there. But instead, when the professor went back to his desk, having peeled off his white coat at last, he stopped as if rooted to the parquet beside his desk, his eyes riveted to it. In the place where the labels had been there sat an orphaned black kitten with a sorry little muzzle, miaowing over a saucer of milk. 'Wh-what's this, may I ask? ! Now this is...' And Kuzmin felt the nape of his neck go cold. At the professor's quiet and pitiful cry, Xenia Nikitishna came running and at once reassured him completely, saying that it was, of course, one of the patients who had abandoned the kitten, as happens not infrequently to professors. They probably have a poor life,' Xenia Nikitishna explained, ""well, and we, of course...'  They started thinking and guessing who might have abandoned it.

'  `She brought it in a little bottle, and poured it into the saucer here,' Xenia Nikitishna explained. 'In any case, take both the kitten and the saucer away,' said Kuzmin, and he accompanied Xenia Nikitishna to the door himself. When he came back, the situation had altered.

6056,"He glanced out and, naturally, was struck dumb. A lady was running across the yard to the opposite wing in nothing but a shift. The professor even knew her name - Marya Alexandrovna. The guffawing came from a young boy. 'What's this? ' Kuzmin said contemptuously. Just then, behind the wall, in the professor's daughter's room, a gramophone began to play the foxtrot  'Hallelujah,' and at the same moment a sparrow's chirping came from behind the professor's back. He turned around and saw a large sparrow hopping on his desk. 'Hm ... keep calm!

6057,"'It flew in as I left the window. Everything's in order! ' the professor told himself, feeling that everything was in complete disorder, and that, of course, owing chiefly to the sparrow. Taking a closer look at him, the professor became convinced at once that this was no ordinary sparrow. The obnoxious little sparrow dipped on its left leg, obviously clowning, dragging it, working it in syncopation - in short, it was dancing the foxtrot to the sounds of the gramophone, like a drunkard in a bar, saucy as could be, casting impudent glances at the professor. Kuzmin's hand fell on the telephone, and he decided to call his old schoolmate Bouret, to ask what such little sparrows might mean at the age of sixty, especially when one's head suddenly starts spinning? The sparrow meanwhile sat on the presentation inkstand, shat in it (I'm not joking! ),then flew up, hung in the air, and, swinging a steely beak, pecked at the glass covering the photograph portraying the entire university graduating class of '94, broke the glass to smithereens, and only then flew out the window. The professor dialled again, and instead of calling Bouret, called a leech bureau, [5] said he was Professor Kuzmin, and asked them to send some leeches to his house at once.

6058,"At this desk sat a woman in a nurse's headscarf, holding a handbag with the word 'Leeches' written on it. The professor screamed as he looked at her mouth: it was a man's mouth, crooked, stretching from ear to ear, with a single fang. The nurse's eyes were dead. 'This bit of cash I'll just pocket,' the nurse said in a male basso, `no point in letting it lie about here. ' She raked up the labels with a bird's claw and began melting into air. Two hours passed. Professor Kuzmin sat in his bedroom on the bed, with leeches hanging from his temples, behind his ears, and on his neck. At Kuzmin's feet, on a quilted silk blanket, sat the grey-moustached Professor Bouret, looking at Kuzmin with condolence and comforting him, saying it was all nonsense.

But as soon as the dirty snow disappeared from the sidewalks and streets, as soon as the slightly rotten, disquieting spring breeze wafted through the window, Margarita Nikolaevna began to grieve more than in winter. She often wept in secret, a long and bitter weeping. She did not know who it was she loved: a living man or a dead one? And the longer the desperate days went on, the more often, especially at twilight, did the thought come to her that she was bound to a dead man. She had either to forget him or to die herself.

On awakening, Margarita did not weep, as she often did, because she awoke with a presentiment that today something was finally going to happen. Having felt this presentiment, she began to warm it and nurture it in her soul, for fear it might abandon her. 'I believe! ' Margarita whispered solemnly. 'I believe! Something will happen!

So Margarita Nikolaevna whispered, looking at the crimson curtains as they filled with sun, dressing anxiously, combing her short curled hair in front of the triple mirror. The dream that Margarita had dreamed that night was indeed unusual. The thing was that during her winter sufferings she had never seen the master in her dreams. He released her for the night, and she suffered only in the daylight hours. But now she had dreamed of him. The dream was of a place unknown to Margarita - hopeless, dismal, under the sullen sky of early spring. In the dream there was this ragged, fleeting, grey sky, and under it a noiseless flock of rooks. Some gnarled little bridge, and under it a muddy spring runlet. Joyless, destitute, half-naked trees.

6068,"This dream means only one of two things,' Margarita Nikolaevna reasoned with herself. 'If he's dead and beckoned to me, it means he has come for me, and I will die soon. And that's very good - because then my suffering will soon end. Or else he's alive, and then the dream can only mean one thing, that he's reminding me of himself! He wants to say that we will see each other again...  Yes, we will see each other very soon! '  Still in the same agitated state, Margarita got dressed and began impressing it upon herself that, essentially, everything was turning out very luckily, and one must know how to catch such lucky moments and take advantage of them. Her husband had gone on a business trip for a whole three days. During those three days she was at her own disposal, and no one could prevent her from thinking what she liked or dreaming what she liked. All five rooms on the top floor of the house, all of this apartment which in Moscow would be the envy of tens of thousands of people, was entirely at her disposal.

6069,"After having tea, she went to a dark, windowless room where suitcases and all sorts of old stuff were kept in two large wardrobes. Squatting down, she opened the bottom drawer of the first of them, and took from under a pile of silk scraps the only precious thing she had in life. Margarita held in her hands an old brown leather album which contained a photographic portrait of the master, a bank savings book with a deposit of ten thousand roubles in his name, the petals of a dried rose pressed between sheets of tissue paper, and part of a full-sized notebook covered with typescript and with a charred bottom edge. Going back to her bedroom with these riches, Margarita Nikolaevna set the photograph up on the triple mirror and sat for about an hour holding the fire-damaged book on her knees, leafing through it and rereading that which, after the burning, had neither beginning nor end: '... The darkness that came from the Mediterranean Sea covered the city hated by the procurator. The hanging bridges connecting the temple with the dread Antonia Tower [2] disappeared, the abyss descended from the sky and flooded the winged gods over the hippodrome, the Has-monaean Palace [3] with its loopholes, the bazaars, caravanserais, lanes, pools... Yershalaim - the great city - vanished as if it had never existed in the world...'  Margarita wanted to read further, but further there was nothing except an irregular, charred fringe. Wiping her tears, Margarita Nikolaevna abandoned the notebook, rested her elbows on the dressing table and, reflected in the mirror, sat for a long time without taking her eyes from the photograph. Then the tears dried up. Margarita neatly folded her possessions, and a few minutes later they were again buried under silk rags, and the lock clicked shut in the dark room. Margarita Nikolaevna was putting her coat on in the front hall in order to go for a walk. The beautiful Natasha, her housemaid, asked what to prepare for the main course, and, receiving the reply that it made no difference, got into conversation with her mistress for her own amusement, and began telling her God knows what, something about how yesterday in the theatre a conjurer began performing such tricks that everybody gasped, gave away two flacons of foreign perfume and a pair of stockings free to everybody, and then, when the s�ance ended, the audience came outside and - bang - everybody turned out to be naked!",test,2,0,0,tea went dark windowless room suitcases sorts old stuff kept two large wardrobes opened bottom drawer first took pile silk scraps precious thing life held hands old brown leather album contained photographic portrait master bank savings book deposit ten thousand roubles name petals dried rose pressed sheets tissue paper part fullsized notebook covered typescript charred bottom edge back bedroom riches set photograph triple mirror sat hour holding firedamaged book knees leafing rereading burning neither beginning end darkness came covered city hated procurator hanging bridges connecting temple dread disappeared abyss descended sky flooded winged gods hippodrome loopholes bazaars caravanserais lanes pools great city vanished never existed world wanted read nothing except irregular charred fringe tears abandoned notebook rested elbows dressing table reflected mirror sat long time without taking eyes photograph tears dried neatly folded possessions minutes later buried silk rags lock clicked shut dark room putting coat front hall order go walk beautiful housemaid asked prepare main course receiving reply made difference got conversation mistress amusement began telling knows something yesterday theatre conjurer began performing tricks everybody gasped gave away two flacons foreign perfume pair stockings free everybody s�ance ended audience came outside bang everybody turned naked

'  Natasha flushed deeply and objected with great ardour that, no, they weren't lying, and that she herself had personally seen today, in a grocer's on the Arbat, one citizeness who came into the shop wearing shoes, but as she was paying at the cash register, the shoes disappeared from her feet, and she was left in just her stockings. Eyes popping out, and a hole in her heel! And the shoes were magic ones from that same s�ance. 'And she left like that? '  `And she left like that!

'I noticed long ago that she's a terrible liar. '  The funny conversation ended with a pleasant surprise for Natasha. Margarita Nikolaevna went to the bedroom and came back holding a pair of stockings and a flacon of eau-de-cologne. Telling Natasha that she, too, wanted to perform a trick, Margarita Nikolaevna gave her both the stockings and the bottle, and said her only request was that she not run around on Tverskaya in nothing but stockings and that she not listen to Darya. Having kissed each other, mistress and housemaid parted. Leaning against the comfortable soft back of the trolley-bus seat, Margarita Nikolaevna rode down the Arbat, now thinking her own thoughts, now listening to the whispers of two citizens sitting in front of her.

A few minutes later Margarita Nikolaevna was sitting on one of the benches under the Kremlin wall, settling herself in such a way that she could see the Manege. [4]  Margarita squinted in the bright sunlight, remembered her last night's dream, remembered how, exactly a year ago to the day and the hour, she had sat next to him on this same bench. And in just the same way as then, her black handbag lay beside her on the bench. He was not beside her this day, but Margarita Nikolaevna mentally conversed with him all the same:  'If you've been exiled, why don't you send me word of yourself? People do send word. Have you stopped loving me? No, for some reason I don't believe that. It means you were exiled and died... Release me, then, I beg you, give me freedom to live, finally, to breathe the air! ...'

Some man gave the well-dressed woman a sidelong glance, attracted by her beauty and her solitude. He coughed and sat down at the end of the same bench that Margarita Nikolaevna was sitting on. Plucking up his courage, he began:  'Definitely nice weather today ...'  But Margarita gave him such a dark look that he got up and left. ""There, for example,' Margarita said mentally to him who possessed her. 'Why, in fact, did I chase that man away?

6075,"But here suddenly the same morning wave of expectation and excitement pushed at her chest. 'Yes, it will happen! '  The wave pushed her a second time, and now she realized that it was a wave of sound. Through the noise of the city there came ever more distinctly the approaching beat of a drum and the sounds of slightly off-key trumpets. The first to appear was a mounted policeman riding slowly past the garden fence, with three more following on foot. Then a slowly rolling truck with the musicians. After that, a new, open hearse moving slowly, a coffin on it all covered with wreaths, and at the corners of the platform four standing persons - three men and one woman. Even from a distance, Margarita discerned that the faces of the people standing on the hearse, accompanying the deceased on his last journey, were somehow strangely bewildered. This was particularly noticeable with regard to the citizeness who stood at the left rear corner of the hearse. This citizeness's fat cheeks were as if pushed out still more from inside by some piquant secret, her puffy little eyes glinted with an ambiguous fire.",test,2,2,0,suddenly morning wave expectation excitement pushed chest happen wave pushed second time realized wave sound noise city came ever distinctly approaching beat drum sounds slightly offkey trumpets first appear mounted policeman riding slowly past garden fence three following foot slowly rolling truck musicians new open hearse moving slowly coffin covered wreaths corners platform four standing persons three men one woman distance discerned faces people standing hearse accompanying deceased last journey somehow strangely bewildered particularly noticeable regard citizeness stood left rear corner hearse citizenesss fat cheeks pushed still inside piquant secret puffy little eyes glinted ambiguous fire
6076,"It seemed that just a little longer and the citizeness, unable to help herself, would wink at the deceased and say: `Have you ever seen the like? Outright mysticism! ...'  The same bewildered faces showed on those in the cortege, who, numbering three hundred or near it, slowly walked behind the hearse. Margarita followed the procession with her eyes, listening to the dismal Turkish drum fading in the distance, producing one and the same 'boom, boom, boom', and thought:  'What a strange funeral ... and what anguish from that ""boom""! Ah, truly, I'd pawn my soul to the devil just to find out whether he's alive or not ...  It would be interesting to know who they're burying. '  'Berlioz, Mikhail Alexandrovich,' a slightly nasal male voice came from beside her, 'chairman of Massolit. '  The surprised Margarita Nikolaevna turned and saw a citizen on her bench, who had apparently sat down there noiselessly while Margarita was watching the procession and, it must be assumed, absent-mindedly asked her last question aloud.

This neighbour turned out to be short of stature, a fiery redhead with a fang, in a starched shirt, a good-quality striped suit, patent leather shoes, and with a bowler hat on his head. His tie was brightly coloured. The surprising thing was that from the pocket where men usually carry a handkerchief or a fountain pen, this gentleman had a gnawed chicken bone sacking out. 'You see,' the redhead explained, `this morning in the hall of Griboedov's, the deceased's head was filched from the coffin. '  `How can that be?

6089,"It'll come in useful, Margarita Nikolaevna, you've aged a lot from grief in the last half-year. ' Margarita flushed but said nothing, and Azazello went on: 'Tonight, at exactly half past nine, be so good as to take off all your clothes and rub your face and your whole body with this ointment. Then do whatever you like, only don't go far from the telephone. At ten I'll call you and tell you all you need to know. You won't have to worry about a thing, you'll be delivered where you need to go and won't be put to any trouble. Understood? '  Margarita was silent for a moment, then replied:  'Understood. This thing is pure gold, you can tell by the weight. So, then, I understand perfectly well that I'm being bribed and drawn into some shady story for which I'm going to pay dearly...'

6090,"'You're at it again? '  'No, wait! '  'Give me back the cream! '  Margarita clutched the box more tightly in her hand and said:  'No, wait! ... I know what I'm getting into. But I'm getting into it on account of him, because I have no more hope for anything in this world. But I want to tell you that if you're going to ruin me, you'll be ashamed! Yes, ashamed!

6091,"'Give it back! ' Azazello cried angrily. 'Give it back and devil take the whole thing. Let them send Behemoth! '  'Oh, no! ' exclaimed Margarita, shocking the passers-by. `I agree to everything, I agree to perform this comedy of rubbing in the ointment, agree to go to the devil and beyond! I won't give it back! '  'Hah!

6092,"Margarita turned to where Azazello was pointing, but found nothing special there. Then she turned back to Azazello, wishing to get an explanation of this absurd 'Hah! ' but there was no one to give an explanation: Margarita Nikolaevna's mysterious interlocutor had disappeared. Margarita quickly thrust her hand into her handbag, where she had put the box before this shouting, and made sure it was there. Then, without reflecting on anything, Margarita hurriedly ran out of the Alexandrovsky Garden. CHAPTER 20  Azazello's Cream  The moon in the clear evening sky hung full, visible through the maple branches. Lindens and acacias drew an intricate pattern of spots on the ground in the garden. The triple bay window, open but covered by a curtain, was lit with a furious electric light. In Margarita Nikolaevna's bedroom all the lamps were burning, illuminating the total disorder in the room.

6093,"Crumpled underwear was also simply lying about on the floor next to a box of cigarettes crushed in the excitement. Shoes stood on the night table next to an unfinished cup of coffee and an ashtray in which a butt was smoking. A black evening dress hung over the back of a chair. The room smelled of perfume. Besides that, the smell of a red-hot iron was coming from somewhere. Margarita Nikolaevna sat in front of the pier-glass, with just a bathrobe thrown over her naked body, and in black suede shoes. A gold bracelet with a watch lay in front of Margarita Nikolaevna, beside the box she had received from Azazello, and Margarita did not take her eyes from its face. At times it began to seem to her that the watch was broken and the hands were not moving. But they were moving, though very slowly, as if sucking, and at last the big hand fell on the twenty-ninth minute past nine. Margarita's heart gave a terrible thump, so that she could not even take hold of the box right away.",test,2,2,0,underwear also simply lying floor next box cigarettes crushed excitement stood night table next unfinished cup coffee ashtray butt smoking black evening dress hung back chair room smelled perfume smell redhot iron coming somewhere sat front pierglass bathrobe thrown naked body black suede shoes gold bracelet watch lay front beside box received take eyes face times began seem watch broken hands moving moving though slowly sucking last big hand fell twentyninth minute past nine heart gave terrible thump could even take hold box right away
6094,"Having mastered herself, Margarita opened it and saw in the box a rich, yellowish cream. It seemed to her that it smelted of swamp slime. With the tip of her finger, Margarita put a small dab of the cream on her palm, the smell of swamp grass and forest grew stronger, and then she began rubbing the cream into her forehead and cheeks with her palm. The cream spread easily and, as it seemed to Margarita, evaporated at once. Having rubbed several times, Margarita glanced into the mirror and dropped the box right on her watch crystal, which became covered with cracks. Margarita closed her eyes, then glanced once again and burst into stormy laughter. Her eyebrows, plucked to a thread with tweezers, thickened and lay in even black arches over her greening eyes. The thin vertical crease cutting the bridge of her nose, which had appeared back then, in October, when the master vanished, disappeared without a trace. So did the yellowish shadows at her temples and the two barely noticeable little webs of wrinkles at the outer corners of her eyes. The skin of her cheeks filled out with an even pink colour, her forehead became white and clear, and the hairdresser's waves in her hair came undone.",test,2,2,2,mastered opened saw box rich yellowish cream seemed smelted swamp slime tip finger put small dab cream palm smell swamp grass forest grew stronger began rubbing cream forehead cheeks palm cream spread easily seemed evaporated rubbed several times glanced mirror dropped box right watch crystal became covered cracks closed eyes glanced burst stormy laughter eyebrows plucked thread tweezers thickened lay even black arches greening eyes thin vertical crease cutting bridge nose appeared back master vanished disappeared without trace yellowish shadows temples two barely noticeable little webs wrinkles outer corners eyes skin cheeks filled even pink colour forehead became white clear hairdressers waves hair came undone
6095,"From the mirror a naturally curly, black-haired woman of about twenty was looking at the thirty-year-old Margarita, baring her teeth and shaking with laughter. Having laughed her fill, Margarita jumped out of her bathrobe with a single leap, dipped freely into the light, rich cream, and with vigorous strokes began rubbing it into the skin of her body. It at once turned pink and tingly. That instant, as if a needle had been snatched from her brain, the ache she had felt in her temple all evening after the meeting in the Alexandrovsky Garden subsided, her leg and arm muscles grew stronger, and then Margarita's body became weightless. She sprang up and hung in the air just above the rug, then was slowly pulled down and descended. 'What a cream! What a cream! ' cried Margarita, throwing herself into an armchair. The rubbings changed her not only externally. Now joy was boiling up in her, in all of her, in every particle of her body, which felt to her like bubbles prickling her body all over.",test,2,2,2,mirror naturally curly blackhaired woman twenty looking thirtyyearold baring teeth shaking laughter laughed fill jumped bathrobe single leap dipped freely light rich cream vigorous strokes began rubbing skin body turned pink tingly instant needle snatched brain ache felt temple evening meeting subsided leg arm muscles grew stronger body became weightless sprang hung air rug slowly pulled descended cream cream cried throwing armchair rubbings changed externally joy boiling every particle body felt like bubbles prickling body
6096,"Margarita felt herself free, free of everything. Besides, she understood with perfect clarity that what was happening was precisely what her presentiment had been telling her in the morning, and that she was leaving her house and her former life forever. But, even so, a thought split off from this former life about the need of fulfilling just one last duty before the start of something new, extraordinary, which was pulling her upwards into the air. And, naked as she was, she ran from her bedroom, flying up in the air time and again, to her husband's study, and, turning on the light, rushed to the desk. On a page torn from a notebook, she pencilled a note quickly and in big letters, without any corrections:  Forgive me and forget me as soon as possible. I am leaving you for ever. Do not look for me, it is useless. I have become a witch from the grief and calamities that have struck me. It's time for me to go.

6097,"Margarita. With a completely unburdened soul, Margarita came flying into the bedroom, and after her ran Natasha, loaded down with things. At once all these things - a wooden hanger with a dress, lace shawls, dark blue satin shoes on shoe-trees and a belt - all of it spilled on the floor, and Natasha clasped her freed hands. 'What, nice? ' Margarita Nikolaevna cried loudly in a hoarse voice. 'How can it be? ' Natasha whispered, backing away. 'How did you do it, Margarita Nikolaevna. '  'It's the cream!

Natasha, forgetting the wrinkled dress lying on the floor, ran up to the pier-glass and fixed her greedy, lit-up eyes on the remainder of the cream. Her lips were whispering something. She again turned to Margarita and said with a sort of awe:  'And, oh, the skin! The skin! Margarita Nikolaevna, your skin is glowing!

6100,"'  Natasha grabbed and bundled up whatever came to her hand - dresses, shoes, stockings, underwear - and ran out of the bedroom. Just then from somewhere at the other end of the lane a thundering, virtuoso waltz burst and flew out an open window, and the chugging of a car driving up to the gate was heard. `Azazello will call now! ' exclaimed Margarita, listening to the waltz spilling into the lane. 'He'll call! And the foreigner's not dangerous, yes, I understand now that he's not dangerous! '  There was the noise of a car driving away from the front gate. The garden gate banged, and steps were heard on the tiles of the path.

6101,"'  Margarita tore the curtain open and sat sideways on the window-sill, her arms around her knees. Moonlight licked her from the right side. Margarita raised her head towards the moon and made a pensive and poetic face. The steps tapped twice more, and then suddenly - silence. After admiring the moon a little longer, sighing for the sake of propriety, Margarita turned her head to the garden and indeed saw Nikolai Ivanovich, who lived on the bottom floor of the same house. Moonlight poured down brightly on Nikolai Ivanovich. He was sitting on a bench, and there was every indication that he had sunk on to it suddenly. The pince-nez on his face was somehow askew, and he was clutching his briefcase in his hands. 'Ah, hello, Nikolai Ivanovich,' Margarita said in a melancholy voice.

6102,"Coming back from a meeting? '  Nikolai Ivanovich made no reply to that. 'And I,' Margarita went on, leaning further out into the garden, 'am sitting alone, as you see, bored, looking at the moon and listening to the waltz...'  Margarita passed her left hand over her temple, straightening a strand of hair, then said crossly:  That is impolite, Nikolai Ivanovich! I'm still a woman after all! It's boorish not to reply when someone is talking to you. '  Nikolai Ivanovich, visible in me moonlight to the last button on his grey waistcoat, to the last hair of his blond, wedge-shaped beard, suddenly smiled a wild smile, rose from the bench, and, apparently beside himself with embarrassment, instead of taking off his hat, waved his briefcase to the side and bent his knees as if about to break into a squatting dance. 'Ah, what a boring type you are, Nikolai Ivanovich! ' Margarita went on. 'Generally, I'm so sick of you all that I can't even tell you, and I'm so happy to be parting with you!

6103,"'  Just then, behind Margarita's back in the bedroom, the telephone exploded. Margarita tore from the window-sill and, forgetting Nikolai Ivanovich, snatched the receiver. 'Azazello speaking,' came from the receiver. 'Dear, dear Azazello! ' cried Margarita. `It's time. Take off,' Azazello spoke into the receiver, and it could be heard in his tone that he liked Margarita's sincere and joyful impulse. 'When you fly over the gate, shout  ""Invisible""!

6104,"'  Margarita hung up, and here something in the next room hobbled woodenly and started beating on the door. Margarita flung it open and a sweeping broom, bristles up, flew dancing into the bedroom. It drummed on the floor with its end, kicking and straining towards the window. Margarita squealed with delight and jumped astride the broom. Only now did the thought flash in the rider that amidst all this fracas she had forgotten to get dressed. She galloped over to the bed and grabbed the first thing she found, some light blue shift. Waving it like a banner, she flew out the window. And the waltz over the garden struck up louder. From the window Margarita slipped down and saw Nikolai Ivanovich on the bench. He seemed to have frozen to it and listened completely dumbfounded to the shouting and crashing coming from the lighted bedroom of the upstairs tenants.",test,2,1,0,hung something next room hobbled woodenly started beating door flung open sweeping broom bristles flew dancing bedroom drummed floor end kicking straining towards window squealed delight jumped astride broom thought flash rider amidst fracas forgotten get dressed galloped bed grabbed first thing found light blue shift like banner flew window waltz garden struck louder window slipped saw bench seemed frozen listened completely dumbfounded shouting crashing coming lighted bedroom upstairs tenants
6105,"'Farewell, Nikolai Ivanovich! ' cried Margarita, capering in front of Nikolai Ivanovich. He gasped and crawled along the bench, pawing it with his hands and knocking down his briefcase. 'Farewell for ever! I'm flying away! ' Margarita shouted above the waltz. Here she realized that she did not need any shift, and with a sinister guffaw threw it over Nikolai Ivanovich's head. The blinded Nikolai Ivanovich crashed from the bench on to the bricks of the path. Margarita turned to take a last look at the house where she had suffered for so long, and saw in the blazing window Natasha's face distorted with amazement.

6106,"' Margarita cried and reared up on the broom. 'Invisible! Invisible! ' she cried still louder, and, flying over the front gates, between the maple branches, which lashed at her face, she flew out into the lane. And after her flew the completely insane waltz. CHAPTER 21  Flight  Invisible and free! Invisible and free! ...  After flying down her own lane, Margarita got into another that crossed the first at right angles. This patched up, darned, crooked and long lane, with the lopsided door of a kerosene shop where they sold paraffin by the cup and liquid against parasites in flacons, she cut across in an instant, and here she realized that, even while completely free and invisible, she still had to be at least somewhat reasonable in her pleasure.

6107,"Dodging it, Margarita clutched the broom tighter and flew more slowly, studying the electric wires and the street signs hanging across the sidewalk. The third lane led straight to the Arbat. Here Margarita became fully accustomed to controlling the broom, realized that it obeyed the slightest touch of her hands and legs, and that, flying over the city, she had to be very attentive and not act up too much. Besides, in the lane it had already become abundantly clear that passers-by did not see the lady flier. No one threw his head back, shouted  'Look! Look! ' or dashed aside, no one shrieked, swooned or guffawed with wild laughter. Margarita flew noiselessly, very slowly, and not high up, approximately on second-floor level. But even with this slow flying, just at the entrance to the dazzlingly lit Arbat she misjudged slightly and struck her shoulder against some illuminated disc with an arrow on it. This angered Margarita.",test,2,2,0,clutched broom tighter flew slowly studying electric wires street signs hanging across sidewalk third lane led straight became fully accustomed controlling broom realized obeyed slightest touch hands legs flying city attentive act much lane already become abundantly clear passersby see lady flier one threw head back shouted dashed aside one shrieked swooned guffawed wild laughter flew noiselessly slowly high approximately secondfloor level even slow flying entrance dazzlingly lit misjudged slightly struck shoulder illuminated disc arrow angered
6108,"She reined in the obedient broom, flew a little aside, and then, suddenly hurling herself at the disc with the butt of the broom, smashed it to smithereens. Bits of glass rained down with a crash, passers-by shied away, a whistle came from somewhere, and Margarita, having accomplished this unnecessary act, burst out laughing. 'On the Arbat I must be more careful,' thought Margarita, 'everything's in such a snarl here, you can't figure it out. '  She began dodging between the wires. Beneath Margarita floated the roofs of buses, trams and cars, and along the sidewalks, as it seemed to Margarita from above, floated rivers of caps. From these rivers little streams branched off and flowed into the flaming maws of night-time shops. 'Eh, what a mess! ' Margarita thought angrily. 'You can't even turn around here. '  She crossed the Arbat, rose higher, to fourth-floor level, and, past the dazzlingly bright tubes on the theatre building at the corner, floated into a narrow lane with tall buildings.",test,2,2,0,reined obedient broom flew little aside suddenly hurling disc butt broom smashed smithereens glass rained crash passersby shied away whistle came somewhere accomplished unnecessary act burst laughing must careful thought snarl cant figure began dodging wires floated roofs buses trams cars along sidewalks seemed floated rivers caps rivers little streams branched flowed flaming maws nighttime shops mess thought angrily cant even turn around crossed rose higher fourthfloor level past dazzlingly bright tubes theatre building corner floated narrow lane tall buildings
6109,"All the windows in them were open, and everywhere radio music came from the windows. Out of curiosity, Margarita peeked into one of them. She saw a kitchen. Two primuses were roaring on the range, and next to them stood two women with spoons in their hands, squabbling. 'You should turn the toilet light off after you, that's what I'm telling you, Pelageya Petrovna,' said the woman before whom there was a pot with some sort of eatables steaming in it, 'or else we'll apply to have you evicted. '  You're a good one yourself,' the other woman answered. `You're both good ones,' Margarita said loudly, clambering over the window-sill into the kitchen. The two quarrelling women turned towards the voice and froze with their dirty spoons in their hands. Margarita carefully reached out between them, turned the knobs of both primuses, and extinguished them.

6110,"But Margarita was already bored with the kitchen and flew out into the lane. Her attention was attracted by the magnificent hulk of an eight-storeyed, obviously just-constructed building at the end of it. Margarita dropped down and, alighting, saw that the facade of the building was covered in black marble, that the doors were wide, that behind their glass could be glimpsed a doorman's buttons and peaked cap with gold braid, and that over the door there was a gold inscription:  'Dramlit House'. Margarita squinted at the inscription, trying to figure out what the word  'Dramlit' might mean. Taking her broom under her arm, Margarita walked into the lobby, shoving the surprised doorman with the door, and saw on the wall beside the elevator a huge black board and on it, written in white letters, apartment numbers and tenants' names. The heading `House of Dramatists and Literary Workers' above the list provoked a suppressed predatory scream in Margarita. Rising in the air, she greedily began to read the last names: Khustov, Dvubratsky, Quant, Beskudnikov, Latunsky...  'Latunsky! ' shrieked Margarita. 'Latunsky!

6111,"'  The doorman at the entrance, even hopping with astonishment, his eyes rolled out, gazed at the black board, trying to understand the marvel: why was the list of tenants suddenly shrieking? But by that time Margarita was already going impetuously up the stairs, repeating in some sort of rapture:  'Latunsky eighty-four...  Latunsky eighty-four...'  Here to the left - 82, to the right - 85, further up, to the left - 84! Here! And the name plate -  '0. Latunsky'. Margarita jumped off the broom, and her hot soles felt the pleasant coolness of the stone landing. Margarita rang once, twice. But no one opened.

6112,"84 on the eighth floor should be grateful to the late Berlioz, chairman of Massolit, for having fallen under a tram-car, and that the memorial gathering had been appointed precisely for that evening. The critic Latunsky was born under a lucky star - it saved him from meeting Margarita, who that Friday became a witch. No one opened the door. Then Margarita raced down at full swing, counting the floors, reached the bottom, burst out the door and, looking up, counted and checked the floors from outside, guessing which precisely were the windows of Latunsky's apartment. Undoubtedly they were the five dark windows at the corner of the building on the eighth floor. Convinced of it, Margarita rose into the air and in a few seconds was stepping through an open window into an unlit room, where only a narrow path from the moon shone silver. Margarita ran down it, felt for the switch. A moment later the whole apartment was lit up. The broom stood in a corner.

6113,"The name plate was in place. Margarita was where she wanted to be. Yes, they say that to this day the critic Latunsky rums pale remembering that terrible evening, and to this day he utters the name of Berlioz with veneration. It is totally unknown what dark and vile criminal job would have marked this evening - returning from the kitchen, Margarita had a heavy hammer in her hands. Naked and invisible, the lady flier tried to control and talk sense into herself; her hands trembled with impatience. Taking careful aim, Margarita struck at the keys of the grand piano, and a first plaintive wail passed all through the apartment. Becker's drawing-room instrument, not guilty of anything, cried out frenziedly. Its keys caved in, ivory veneer flew in all directions. The instrument howled, wailed, rasped and jangled.

6114,"Breathing hard, Margarita tore and mangled the strings with the hammer. Finally getting tired, she left off and flopped into an armchair to catch her breath. Water was roaring terribly in the bathroom, and in the kitchen as well. 'Seems it's already overflowing on the floor...' Margarita thought, and added aloud:  'No point sitting around, however. '  The stream was already running from the kitchen into the corridor. Splashing barefoot through the water, Margarita carried buckets of water from the kitchen to the critic's study and emptied them into his desk drawers. Then, after smashing the door of the bookcase in the same study with her hammer, she rushed to the bedroom. Shattering the mirror on the wardrobe, she took out the critic's dress suit and drowned it in the tub. A large bottle of ink, picked up in the study, she poured over the luxuriously plumped-up double bed. The devastation she wrought afforded her a burning pleasure, and yet it seemed to her all the while that the results came out somehow meagre.",test,2,2,0,hard tore mangled strings hammer getting tired left flopped armchair catch breath roaring terribly bathroom kitchen well already overflowing floor thought added aloud point sitting around however stream already running kitchen corridor barefoot water carried buckets water kitchen critics study emptied desk drawers smashing door bookcase study hammer rushed bedroom mirror wardrobe took critics dress suit drowned tub large bottle ink picked study poured luxuriously plumpedup double bed devastation wrought afforded burning pleasure yet seemed results came somehow meagre
6115,"Therefore she started doing whatever came along. She smashed pots of ficus in the room with the grand piano. Before finishing that, she went back to the bedroom, slashed the sheets with a kitchen knife, and broke the glass on the framed photographs. She felt no fatigue, only the sweat poured from her in streams. Just then, in apartment no. 82, below Latunsky's apartment, the housekeeper of the dramatist Quant was having tea in the kitchen, perplexed by the clatter, running and jangling coming from above. Raising her head towards the ceiling, she suddenly saw it changing colour before her eyes from white to some deathly blue. The spot was widening right in front of her and drops suddenly swelled out on it. For about two minutes the housekeeper sat marvelling at this phenomenon, until finally a real rain began to fall from the ceiling, drumming on the floor. Here she jumped up, put a bowl under the stream, which did not help at all, because the rain expanded and began pouring down on the gas stove and the table with dishes.",test,2,2,0,started whatever came along smashed pots ficus room grand piano finishing went back bedroom slashed sheets kitchen knife broke glass framed photographs felt fatigue sweat poured streams apartment apartment housekeeper dramatist tea kitchen perplexed clatter running jangling coming head towards ceiling suddenly saw changing colour eyes white deathly blue spot widening right front drops suddenly swelled two minutes housekeeper sat marvelling phenomenon finally real rain began fall ceiling drumming floor jumped put bowl stream help rain expanded began pouring gas stove table dishes
6116,"Then, crying out, Quant's housekeeper ran from the apartment to the stairs and at once the bell started ringing in Latunsky's apartment. Well, they're ringing ... Time to be off,' said Margarita. She sat on the broom, listening to the female voice shouting through the keyhole:  'Open up, open up! Dusya, open the door! Is your water overflowing, or what? We're being flooded! '  Margarita rose up about a metre and hit the chandelier. Two bulbs popped and pendants flew in all directions.

6117,"The pane sobbed, and splinters went cascading down the marble-faced wall. Margarita flew to the next window. Far below, people began running about on the sidewalk, one of the two cars parked by the entrance honked and drove off. Having finished with Latunsky's windows, Margarita floated to the neighbour's apartment. The blows became more frequent, the lane was filled with crashing and jingling. The doorman ran out of the main entrance, looked up, hesitated a moment, evidently not grasping at first what he ought to undertake, put the whistle to his lips, and started whistling furiously. To the sound of this whistle, Margarita, with particular passion, demolished the last window on the eighth floor, dropped down to the seventh, and started smashing the windows there. Weary of his prolonged idleness behind the glass doors of the entrance, the doorman put his whole soul into his whistling, following Margarita precisely as if he were her accompanist. In the pauses as she flew from window to window, he would draw his breath, and at each of Margarita's strokes, he would puff out his cheeks and dissolve in whistling, drilling the night air right up to the sky. His efforts, combined with the efforts of the infuriated Margarita, yielded great results.",test,2,2,0,pane sobbed splinters went cascading marblefaced wall flew next window people began running sidewalk one two cars parked entrance honked drove finished windows floated neighbours apartment blows became frequent lane filled crashing jingling doorman ran main entrance looked hesitated moment evidently grasping first ought undertake put whistle lips started whistling furiously sound whistle particular passion demolished last window eighth floor dropped seventh started smashing windows prolonged idleness behind glass doors entrance doorman put whole soul whistling following precisely accompanist pauses flew window window would draw breath strokes would puff cheeks dissolve whistling drilling night air right sky efforts combined efforts infuriated yielded great results
6118,"There was panic in the house. Those windows left intact were flung open, people's heads appeared in them and hid at once, while the open windows, on the contrary, were being closed. In the buildings across the street, against the lighted background of windows, there appeared the dark silhouettes of people trying to understand why the windows in the new Dramlit building were bursting for no reason at all. In the lane people ran to Dramlit House, and inside, on all the stairways, there was the stamping of people rushing about with no reason or sense. Quant's housekeeper shouted to those running up the stairs that they were being flooded, and she was soon joined by Khustov's housekeeper from apartment no. 80, located just below Quant's apartment. At Khustov's it was pouring from the ceiling in both the kitchen and the toilet. Finally, in Quant's kitchen a huge slab of plaster fell from the ceiling, breaking all the dirty dishes, after which came a real downpour, the water gushing from the grid of wet, hanging lath as if from a bucket. Then on the steps of the main entrance shouting began. Flying past the penultimate window of the fourth floor, Margarita peeked in and saw a man who in panic had pulled on a gas mask.",test,2,2,0,panic house windows left intact flung open peoples heads appeared hid open windows contrary closed buildings across street lighted background windows appeared dark silhouettes people trying understand windows new building bursting reason lane people ran inside stairways stamping people rushing reason sense housekeeper shouted running stairs flooded soon joined housekeeper apartment located apartment pouring ceiling kitchen toilet kitchen huge slab plaster fell ceiling breaking dirty dishes came real downpour water gushing grid wet hanging lath bucket steps main entrance shouting began past penultimate window fourth floor peeked saw man panic pulled gas mask
6119,"Hitting his window with the hammer, Margarita scared him off, and he disappeared from the room. And unexpectedly the wild havoc ceased. Slipping down to the third floor, Margarita peeked into the end window, covered by a thin, dark little curtain. In the room a little lamp was burning weakly under a shade. In a small bed with net sides sat a boy of about four, listening timorously. There were no grown-ups in the room, evidently they had all run out of the apartment. They're breaking the windows,' the boy said and called: 'Mama! '  No one answered, and then he said:  'Mama, I'm afraid. '  Margarita drew the little curtain aside and flew in.

' the boy asked, ceasing to tremble. With a slingshot, with a slingshot,' Margarita confirmed, 'and you go to sleep. '  'It's Sitnik,' said the boy, ""he's got a slingshot. '  Well, of course it's he! '  The boy looked slyly somewhere to the side and asked:  'And where are you, ma'am? '  'I'm nowhere,' answered Margarita, 'I'm your dream.

'  'Well, be my dream, then,' the boy agreed, and at once lay down and put his hand under his cheek. 'I'll tell you a story,' Margarita began, and placed her hot hand on his cropped head. `Once there was a certain lady...  And she had no children, and generally no happiness either. And so first she cried for a long time, and then she became wicked...' Margarita fell silent and took away her hand - the boy was asleep. Margarita quietly placed the hammer on the window-sill and flew out the window. There was turmoil by the building. On the asphalt pavement strewn with broken glass, people were running and shouting something. Policemen were already flashing among them.

6122,"But what followed no longer interested Margarita. Taking aim, so as not to brush against any wires, she clutched her broom more tightly and in a moment was high above the ill-fated house. The lane beneath her went askew and plunged away. In place of it a mass of roofs appeared under Margarita's feet, criss-crossed at various angles by shining paths. It all unexpectedly went off to one side, and the strings of lights smeared and merged. Margarita made one more spurt and the whole mass of roofs fell through the earth, and in place of it a lake of quivering electric lights appeared below, and this lake suddenly rose up vertically and then appeared over Margarita's head, while the moon flashed under her feet. Realizing that she had flipped over, Margarita resumed a normal position and, glancing back, saw that there was no longer any lake, and that there behind her only a pink glow remained on the horizon. That, too, disappeared a second later, and Margarita saw that she was alone with the moon flying above and to the left of her. Margarita's hair had long been standing up in a shock, and the whistling moonlight bathed her body. Seeing two rows of widespread lights merge into two unbroken fiery lines, seeing how quickly they vanished behind her, Margarita realized that she was flying at an enormous speed and was amazed that she was not out of breath.",test,2,2,2,followed longer interested aim brush wires clutched broom tightly moment high illfated house lane beneath went askew plunged away place mass roofs appeared feet crisscrossed various angles shining paths unexpectedly went one side strings lights smeared merged made one spurt whole mass roofs fell earth place lake quivering electric lights appeared lake suddenly rose vertically appeared head moon flashed feet flipped resumed normal position glancing back saw longer lake behind pink glow remained horizon disappeared second later saw alone moon flying left hair long standing shock whistling moonlight bathed body two rows widespread lights merge two unbroken fiery lines seeing quickly vanished behind realized flying enormous speed amazed breath
6123,"After a few seconds, a new glow of electric lights flared up far below in the earthly blackness and hurtled under the flying woman's feet, but immediately spun away like a whirligig and fell into the earth. A few seconds later - exactly the same phenomenon. 'Towns! Towns! ' cried Margarita. Two or three times after that she saw dully gleaming sabres lying in open black sheaths below her and realized that these were rivers. Turning her head up and to the left, the flying woman admired the way the moon madly raced back over her towards Moscow, and at the same time strangely stayed in its place, so that there could be clearly seen on it something mysterious, dark - a dragon, or a little humpbacked horse, its sharp muzzle turned to the abandoned city. Here the thought came to Margarita that, in fact, there was no need for her to drive her broom so furiously, that she was depriving herself of the opportunity of seeing anything properly, of revelling properly in her own flight. Something told her that she would be waited for in the place she was flying to, and that there was no need for her to become bored with this insane speed and height.

6124,"This downward glide, as on an airy sled, gave her the greatest pleasure. The earth rose to meet her, and in its hitherto formless black density the charms and secrets of the earth on a moonlit night revealed themselves. The earth was coming to her, and Margarita was already enveloped in the scent of greening forests. Margarita was flying just above the mists of a dewy meadow, then over a pond. Under Margarita sang a chorus of frogs, and from somewhere far away, stirring her heart deeply for some reason, came the noise of a train. Soon Margarita saw it. It was crawling slowly along like a caterpillar, spraying sparks into the air. Going ahead of it, Margarita passed over yet another watery mirror, in which a second moon floated under her feet, dropped down lower still and went on, her feet nearly touching the tops of the huge pines. A heavy noise of ripping air came from behind and began to overtake Margarita.

6125,"Margarita looked back and saw some complex dark object catching up with her. As it drew nearer to Margarita, it became more distinct - a mounted flying person could be seen. And finally it became quite distinct: slowing down, Natasha came abreast of Margarita. Completely naked, her dishevelled hair flying in the air, she flew astride a fat hog, who was clutching a briefcase in his front hoofs, while his hind hoofs desperately threshed the air. Occasionally gleaming in the moonlight, then fading, the pince-nez that had fallen off his nose flew beside the hog on a string, and the hog's hat kept sliding down over his eyes. Taking a close look, Margarita recognized the hog as Nikolai Ivanovich, and then her laughter rang out over the forest, mingled with the laughter of Natasha. 'Natashka!

' she shouted, leaning towards the hog's ear. 'Goddess! ' howled the hog, 'I can't fly so fast! I may lose important papers, Natalya Prokofyevna, I protest! '  'Ah, devil take you and your papers!

6128,"' the hog yelled imploringly. Flying beside Margarita, Natasha laughingly told her what happened in the house after Margarita Nikolaevna flew off over the gates. Natasha confessed that, without ever touching any of the things she had been given, she threw off her clothes, rushed to the cream, and immediately smeared herself with it. The same thing happened with her as with her mistress. Just as Natasha, laughing with joy, was revelling in her own magical beauty before the mirror, the door opened and Nikolai Ivanovich appeared before her. He was agitated; in his hands he was holding Margarita Nikolaevna's shift and his own hat and briefcase. Seeing Natasha, Nikolai Ivanovich was dumbfounded. Getting some control of himself, all red as a lobster, he announced that he felt it was his duty to pick up the little shift and bring it personally...  The things he said, the blackguard!

6129,"The money he promised! He said Klavdia Petrovna would never learn of it. Well, speak, am I lying? ' Natasha shouted to the hog, who only turned his muzzle away abashedly. In the bedroom, carried away with her own mischief, Natasha dabbed some cream on Nikolai Ivanovich and was herself struck dumb with astonishment. The respectable ground-floor tenant's face shrank to a pig's snout, and his hands and feet acquired little hoofs. Looking at himself in the mirror, Nikolai Ivanovich let out a wild and desperate howl, but it was already too late. A few seconds later, saddled up, he was flying out of Moscow to devil knows where, sobbing with grief. `I demand that my normal appearance be restored to me!

' Natasha cried, pinching the hog's ear. 'And I used to be a goddess? What was it you called me? '  'Venus!

6132,"Faster! Faster! Come on, speed it up'' She dug her heels into the hog's sides, which had grown thinner during this insane ride, and he tore on, so that the air ripped open again, and a moment later Natasha could be seen only as a black speck in the distance, then vanished completely, and the noise of her flight melted away. Margarita flew as slowly as before through the deserted and unfamiliar place, over hills strewn with occasional boulders among huge, widely spaced pines. Margarita now flew not over the tops of the pines but between their trunks, silvered on one side by the moon. The light shadow of the flying woman glided over the ground ahead, the moon shining now on Margarita's back. Margarita sensed the proximity of water, and guessed that her goal was near. The pines parted and Margarita rode slowly through the air up to a chalk cliff. Beyond this cliff, down in the shadows, lay a river. Mist hung clinging to the bushes on the cliff, but the opposite bank was flat and low.",test,2,2,0,speed dug heels hogs sides grown thinner insane ride tore air ripped open moment later could seen black speck distance vanished completely noise flight melted away flew slowly deserted unfamiliar place hills strewn occasional boulders among huge widely spaced pines flew tops pines trunks silvered one side moon light shadow flying woman glided ground ahead moon shining back sensed proximity water guessed goal near pines parted rode slowly air chalk cliff cliff shadows lay river hung clinging bushes cliff opposite bank flat low
6133,"On it, under a solitary group of spreading trees, the light of a bonfire flickered and some small figures could be seen moving about. It seemed to Margarita that some nagging, merry little tune was coming from there. Further off, as far as the eye could see, there was no sign of habitation or people on the silvered plain. Margarita leaped off the cliff and quickly descended to the water. The water enticed her after her airy race. Casting the broom aside, she ran and threw herself head first into the water. Her light body pierced the water's surface like an arrow, and the column of water thrown up almost reached the moon. The water turned out to be warm as in a bathhouse, and, emerging from the depths, Margarita swam her fill in the total solitude of night in this river. There was no one near Margarita, but a little further away, behind the bushes, splashing and grunting could be heard - someone was also having a swim there. Margarita ran out on to the bank.",test,2,2,0,solitary group spreading trees light bonfire flickered small figures could seen moving seemed nagging merry little tune coming far eye could see sign habitation people silvered plain leaped cliff quickly descended water water enticed airy race broom aside ran threw head first water light body pierced waters surface like arrow column water thrown almost reached moon water turned warm bathhouse emerging depths swam fill total solitude night river one near little away behind bushes splashing grunting could heard someone also swim ran bank
6134,"Her body was on fire after the swim. She felt no fatigue, and was joyfully capering about on the moist grass. Suddenly she stopped dancing and pricked up her ears. The grunting came closer, and from behind the willow bushes some naked fat man emerged, with a black silk top hat pushed back on his head. His feet were covered with slimy mud, which made it seem that the swimmer was wearing black shoes. Judging by his huffing and hiccuping, he was properly drunk, as was confirmed, incidentally, by the fact that the river suddenly began to smell of cognac. Seeing Margarita, the fat man peered at her and then shouted joyfully:  `What's this? Who is it I see? Claudine, it's you, the ungrieving widow!

6135,"' and he came at her with his greetings. Margarita stepped back and replied with dignity:  'Go to the devil! What sort of Claudine am I to you? Watch out who you're talking to,' and, after a moment's reflection, she added to her words a long, unprintable oath. All this had a sobering effect on the light-minded fat man. 'Ah! ' he exclaimed softly and gave a start, `magnanimously forgive me, bright Queen Margot! I mistook you for someone else. The cognac's to blame, curse it! ' The fat man lowered himself to one knee, holding the top hat far out, made a bow, and started to prattle, mixing Russian phrases with French, some nonsense about the bloody wedding of his friend Guessard in Paris, and about the cognac, and about being mortified by his sad mistake.",test,2,1,0,came greetings stepped back replied dignity devil sort youre talking moments reflection added words long unprintable oath sobering effect lightminded fat man exclaimed softly gave start forgive bright mistook someone else cognacs blame curse fat man lowered one knee holding top hat far made bow started prattle mixing phrases nonsense bloody wedding friend cognac mortified sad mistake
6136,"`Why don't you put your trousers on, you son of a bitch,' Margarita said, softening. The fat man grinned joyfully, seeing that Margarita was not angry, and rapturously declared that he found himself without trousers at the given moment only because in his absent-mindedness he had left them on the Yenisey River, where he had been swimming just before, but that he would presently fly there, since it was close at hand, and then, entrusting himself to her favour and patronage, he began to back away and went on backing away until he slipped and fell backwards into the water. But even as he fell, he kept on his face, framed in small side-whiskers, a smile of rapture and devotion. Here Margarita gave a piercing whistle and, mounting the broom that flew up to her, crossed to the opposite bank of the fiver. The shadow of the chalk mountain did not reach that far, and the whole bank was flooded with moonlight. As soon as Margarita touched the moist grass, the music under the pussy willows struck up louder, and a sheaf of sparks flew up more merrily from the bonfire. Under the pussy-willow branches, strewn with tender, fluffy catkins, visible in the moonlight, sat two rows of fat-faced frogs, puffing up as if they were made of rubber, playing a bravura march on wooden pipes. Glowing marsh-lights hung on willow twigs in front of the musicians, lighting up the music; the restless light of the bonfire danced on the frogs' faces. The march was being played in honour of Margarita. She was given a most solemn reception.",test,2,3,0,dont put trousers son bitch said softening fat man grinned joyfully seeing angry rapturously declared found without trousers given moment absentmindedness left swimming would presently fly since close hand entrusting favour patronage began back away went backing away slipped fell backwards water even fell kept face framed small sidewhiskers smile rapture devotion gave piercing whistle mounting broom flew crossed opposite bank fiver shadow chalk mountain reach far whole bank flooded moonlight soon touched moist grass music pussy willows struck louder sheaf sparks flew merrily bonfire pussywillow branches strewn tender fluffy catkins visible moonlight sat two rows fatfaced frogs puffing made rubber playing bravura march wooden pipes marshlights hung willow twigs front musicians lighting music restless light bonfire danced frogs faces march played honour given solemn reception
6137,"Transparent naiads stopped their round dance over the river and waved weeds at Margarita, and their far-audible greetings moaned across the deserted, greenish bank. Naked witches, jumping from behind the pussy willows, formed a line and began curtseying and making courtly bows. Someone goat-legged flew up and bent to her hand, spread silk on the grass, inquired whether the queen had had a good swim, and invited her to lie down and rest. Margarita did just that. The goat-legged one offered her a glass of champagne, she drank it, and her heart became warm at once. Having inquired about Natasha's whereabouts, she received the reply that Natasha had already taken her swim and had flown ahead to Moscow on her hog, to warn them that Margarita would soon arrive and to help prepare her attire. Margarita's short stay under the pussy willows was marked by one episode: there was a whistling in the air, and a black body, obviously missing its mark, dropped into the water. A few moments later there stood before Margarita that same fat side-whiskerist who had so unsuccessfully introduced himself on the other bank. He had apparently managed to get to the Yenisey and back, for he was in full evening dress, though wet from head to foot. The cognac had done him another bad turn: as he came down, he landed in the water after all.",test,2,2,2,naiads stopped round dance river waved weeds faraudible greetings moaned across deserted greenish bank witches jumping behind pussy willows formed line began curtseying making courtly bows goatlegged flew bent hand spread silk grass inquired whether queen good swim invited lie rest goatlegged one offered glass champagne drank heart became warm inquired whereabouts received reply already taken swim flown ahead hog warn would soon arrive help prepare attire short stay pussy willows marked one episode whistling air black body obviously missing mark dropped water moments later stood fat sidewhiskerist unsuccessfully introduced bank apparently managed get back full evening dress though wet head foot cognac done another bad turn came landed water
6138,"But he did not lose his smile even on this lamentable occasion, and the laughing Margarita admitted him to her hand. Then they all started getting ready. The naiads finished their dance in the moonlight and melted into it. The goat-legged one deferentially inquired of Margarita how she had come to me river. On learning that she had come riding on a broom, he said:  'Oh, but why, it's so inconvenient! ' He instantly slapped together some dubious-looking telephone from two twigs, and demanded of someone that a car be sent that very minute, which, that same minute, was actually done. An open, light sorrel car came down on the island, only in the driver's seat there sat no ordinary-looking driver, but a black, long-beaked rook in an oilcloth cap and gauntlets. The little island was becoming deserted. The witches flew off, melting into the moon-blaze. The bonfire was dying down, and the coals were covering over with hoary ash.",test,2,2,0,lose smile even lamentable occasion laughing admitted hand started getting ready naiads finished dance moonlight melted goatlegged one deferentially inquired come river learning come riding broom said inconvenient instantly slapped together dubiouslooking telephone two twigs demanded someone car sent minute minute actually done open light sorrel car came island drivers seat sat ordinarylooking driver black longbeaked rook oilcloth cap gauntlets little island becoming deserted witches flew melting moonblaze bonfire dying coals covering hoary ash
6139,"The goat-legged one helped Margarita in, and she sank on to the wide back seat of the sorrel car. The car roared, sprang up, and climbed almost to the moon; the island vanished, the river vanished, Margarita was racing to Moscow. CHAPTER 22  By Candlelight  The steady humming of the car, flying high above the earth, lulled Margarita, and the moonlight warmed her pleasantly. Closing her eyes, she offered her face to the wind and thought with a certain sadness about the unknown river bank she had left behind, which she sensed she would never see again. After all the sorceries and wonders of that evening, she could already guess precisely whom she was being taken to visit, but that did not frighten her. The hope that there she would manage to regain her happiness made her fearless. However, she was not to dream of this happiness for long in the car. Either the rook knew his job well, or the car was a good one, but Margarita soon opened her eyes and saw beneath her not the forest darkness, but a quivering sea of Moscow lights. The black bird-driver unscrewed the right front wheel in flight, then landed the car in some completely deserted cemetery in the Dorogomilovo area. Having deposited the unquestioning Margarita by one of the graves along with her broom, the rook started the car, aiming it straight into the ravine beyond the cemetery.",test,2,2,2,goatlegged one helped sank wide back seat sorrel car car roared sprang climbed almost moon island vanished river vanished racing steady humming car flying high earth lulled moonlight warmed pleasantly eyes offered face wind thought certain sadness unknown river bank left behind sensed would never see sorceries wonders evening could already guess precisely taken visit frighten hope would manage regain happiness made fearless dream happiness long car rook knew job well car good one soon opened eyes saw beneath forest darkness quivering sea lights black birddriver unscrewed right front wheel flight landed car completely deserted cemetery area deposited unquestioning one graves along broom rook started car aiming straight ravine beyond cemetery
6140,"It tumbled noisily into it and there perished. The rook saluted deferentially, mounted the wheel, and flew off. A black cloak appeared at once from behind one of the tombstones. A fang flashed in the moonlight, and Margarita recognized Azazello. He gestured to Margarita, inviting her to get on the broom, jumped on to a long rapier himself, they both whirled up and in a few seconds, unnoticed by anyone, landed near no. 302-bis on Sadovaya Street. When the companions passed through the gateway, carrying the broom and rapier under their arms, Margarita noticed a man languishing there in a cap and high boots, probably waiting for someone. Light though Azazello's and Margarita's footsteps were, the solitary man heard them and twitched uneasily, not understanding who had produced them. By the sixth entrance they met a second man looking surprisingly like the first.

6141,"Footsteps ... the man turned and frowned uneasily. And when the door opened and closed, he dashed after the invisible enterers, peeked into the front hall, but of course saw nothing. A third man, the exact copy of the second, and therefore also of the first, stood watch on the third-floor landing. He smoked strong cigarettes, and Margarita had a fit of coughing as she walked past him. The smoker, as if pricked with a pin, jumped up from the bench he was sitting on, began turning around uneasily, went to the banister, looked down. Margarita and her companion were by that time already at the door of apartment no. 50. They did not ring the bell. Azazello noiselessly opened the door with his own key.

6142,"It was as dark as underground, so that she involuntarily clutched at Azazello's cloak for fear of stumbling. But then, from far away and above, the light of some little lamp flickered and began to approach. Azazello took the broom from under Margarita's arm as they walked, and it disappeared without a sound in the darkness. Here they started climbing some wide steps, and Margarita began to think there would be no end to them. She was struck that the front hall of an ordinary Moscow apartment could contain this extraordinary invisible, yet quite palpable, endless stairway. But the climb ended, and Margarita realized that she was on a landing. The light came right up to them, and Margarita saw in this light the face of a man, long and black, holding a little lamp in his hand.

6143,"The flickering light was reflected not in the cracked pince-nez, which it had long been time to throw in the trash, but in a monocle, which, true, was also cracked. The little moustache on his insolent face was twirled up and waxed, and Koroviev's blackness was quite simply explained - he was in formal attire. Only his chest was white. The magician, choirmaster, sorcerer, interpreter - devil knows what he really was - Koroviev, in short, made his bows and, with a broad sweep of the lamp in the air, invited Margarita to follow him. Azazello disappeared. 'An amazingly strange evening,' thought Margarita, 'I expected anything but this. Has their electricity gone off, or what? But the most striking thing is the size of the place...  How could it all be squeezed into a Moscow apartment? There's simply no way it could be! ...'

6144,"Koroviev stopped by some sort of little settee, placed his lamp on some sort of post, gestured for Margarita to sit down, and settled himself beside her in a picturesque attitude, leaning his elbow on the post. 'Allow me to introduce myself to you,' creaked Koroviev, 'Koroviev. You are surprised there's no light? Economy, so you think, of course? Unh-unh! May the first executioner to come along, even one of those who later this evening will have the honour of kissing your knee, lop my head off on this very post if it's so! Messire simply doesn't like electric light, and we'll save it for the very last moment. And then, believe me, there'll be no lack of it. Perhaps it would even be better to have less.

6145,"'No,' replied Margarita, 'most of all I'm struck that there's room for all this. ' She made a gesture with her hand, emphasizing the enormousness of the hall. Koroviev grinned sweetly, which made the shadows stir in the folds of his nose. `The most uncomplicated thing of all! ' he replied. 'For someone well acquainted with the fifth dimension, it costs nothing to expand space to the desired proportions. I'll say more, respected lady - to devil knows what proportions! I, however,' Koroviev went on chattering, ""have known people who had no idea, not only of the fifth dimension, but generally of anything at all, and who nevertheless performed absolute wonders in expanding their space. Thus, for instance, one city-dweller, as I've been told, having obtained a three-room apartment on Zemlyanoy Val, transformed it instantly, without any fifth dimension or other things that addle the brain, into a four-room apartment by dividing one room in half with a partition. `He forthwith exchanged that one for two separate apartments in different parts of Moscow: one of three rooms, the other of two.",test,2,2,0,replied struck theres room made gesture hand emphasizing enormousness hall grinned sweetly made shadows stir folds nose uncomplicated thing replied someone well acquainted fifth dimension costs nothing expand space desired proportions say respected lady devil knows proportions however went chattering known people idea fifth dimension generally anything nevertheless performed absolute wonders expanding space instance one citydweller told obtained threeroom apartment transformed instantly without fifth dimension things addle brain fourroom apartment dividing one room half partition forthwith exchanged one two separate apartments different parts one three rooms two
6146,"You must agree that that makes five. The three-room one he exchanged for two separate ones, each of two rooms, and became the owner, as you can see for yourself, of six rooms - true, scattered in total disorder all over Moscow. He was just getting ready to perform his last and most brilliant leap, by advertising in the newspapers that he wanted to exchange six rooms in different parts of Moscow for one five-room apartment on Zemlyanoy Val, when his activity ceased for reasons independent of him. He probably also has some sort of room now, only I venture to assure you it is not in Moscow. A real slicker, you see, ma'am, and you keep talking about the fifth dimension! '  Though she had never talked about the fifth dimension, and it was Koroviev himself who kept talking about it, Margarita laughed gaily, hearing the story of the adventures of the apartment slicker. Koroviev went on:  'But to business, to business, Margarita Nikolaevna. You're quite an intelligent woman, and of course have already guessed who our host is. '  Margarita's heart thumped, and she nodded. Well, and so, ma'am,' Koroviev said, 'and so, we're enemies of any sort of reticence and mysteriousness.",test,2,2,0,must agree makes five threeroom one exchanged two separate ones two rooms became owner see six rooms true scattered total disorder getting ready perform last brilliant leap advertising newspapers wanted exchange six rooms different parts one fiveroom apartment activity ceased reasons independent probably also sort room venture assure real slicker see maam keep talking fifth dimension never talked fifth dimension kept talking laughed gaily hearing story adventures apartment slicker went business business quite intelligent woman course already guessed host heart thumped nodded maam said enemies sort reticence mysteriousness
6147,"Messire gives one ball annually. It is called the spring ball of the full moon, or the ball of the hundred kings. Such a crowd! ...' here Koroviev held his cheek as if he had a toothache. 'However, I hope you'll be convinced of it yourself. Now, Messire is a bachelor, as you yourself, of course, understand. Yet a hostess is needed,' Koroviev spread his arms, 'without a hostess, you must agree ...'  Margarita listened to Koroviev, trying not to miss a single word; she felt cold under her heart, the hope of happiness made her head spin. 'The tradition has been established,' Koroviev said further, 'that the hostess of the ball must without fail be named Margarita, first, and second, she must be a native of the place. And we, you will kindly note, are travelling and at the present moment are in Moscow. We found one hundred and twenty-one Margaritas in Moscow, and, would you believe it,' here Koroviev slapped himself on the thigh with despair, 'not one of them was suitable!",test,2,2,0,gives one ball annually called spring ball full moon ball hundred kings crowd held cheek toothache hope youll convinced bachelor course understand hostess needed spread arms hostess must agree listened trying miss single word felt cold heart hope happiness made head spin tradition established said hostess ball must without fail named first second must native place kindly note travelling present moment found one hundred twentyone would believe slapped thigh despair one suitable
6148,"And, at last, by a happy fate ...'  Koroviev grinned expressively, inclining his body, and again Margarita's heart went cold. 'In short! ' Koroviev cried out 'Quite shortly: you won't refuse to take this responsibility upon yourself? '  'I won't refuse! ' Margarita replied firmly. 'Done! ' said Koroviev and, raising the little lamp, added: Please follow me. '  They walked between the columns and finally came to another hall, in which for some reason there was a strong smell of lemons, where some rustlings were heard and something brushed against Margarita's head. She gave a start. 'Don't be frightened,' Koroviev reassured her sweetly, taking Margarita under the arm, 'it's Behemoth's contrivances for the ball, that's all.",test,2,1,1,last happy fate grinned expressively inclining body heart went cold short cried shortly wont refuse take responsibility upon wont refuse replied firmly said raising little lamp added follow walked columns finally came another hall reason strong smell lemons rustlings heard something brushed head gave start frightened reassured sweetly taking arm contrivances ball thats
6149,"And generally I will allow myself the boldness of advising you, Margarita Nikolaevna, never to be afraid of anything. It is unreasonable. The ball will be a magnificent one, I will not conceal it from you. We will see persons the scope of whose power in their own time was extremely great. But, really, once you think how microscopically small their possibilities were compared to those of him to whose retinue I have the honour of belonging, it seems ridiculous, and even, I would say, sad ...  And, besides, you are of royal blood yourself. '  'Why of royal blood? ' Margarita whispered fearfully, pressing herself to Koroviev. 'Ah, my Queen,' Koroviev rattled on playfully, 'questions of blood are the most complicated questions in the world! And if we were to question certain great-grandmothers, especially those who enjoyed a reputation as shrinking violets, the most astonishing secrets would be uncovered, my respected Margarita Nikolaevna!

6150,"There are things in which neither barriers of rank nor even the borders between countries have any validity whatsoever. A hint: one of the French queens who lived in the sixteenth century would, one must suppose, be very amazed if someone told her that after all these years I would be leading her lovely great-great-great-granddaughter on my arm through the ballrooms of Moscow. But we've arrived! '  Here Koroviev blew out his lamp and it vanished from his hands, and Margarita saw lying on the floor in front of her a streak of light under some dark door. And on this door Koroviev softly knocked. Here Margarita became so agitated that her teeth chattered and a chill ran down her spine. The door opened. The room turned out to be very small. Margarita saw a wide oak bed with dirty, rumpled and bunched-up sheets and pillows. Before the bed was an oak table with carved legs, on which stood a candelabrum with sockets in the form of a bird's claws.",test,2,2,0,things neither barriers rank even borders countries validity whatsoever hint one queens lived sixteenth century would one must suppose amazed someone told years would leading lovely greatgreatgreatgranddaughter arm ballrooms weve arrived blew lamp vanished hands saw lying floor front streak light dark door door softly knocked became agitated teeth chattered chill ran spine door opened room turned small saw wide oak bed dirty rumpled bunchedup sheets pillows bed oak table carved legs stood candelabrum sockets form birds claws
6151,"In these seven golden claws' burned thick wax candles. Besides that, there was on the table a large chessboard with pieces of extraordinarily artful workmanship. A little low bench stood on a small, shabby rug. There was yet another table with some golden bowl and another candelabrum with branches in the form of snakes. The room smelled of sulphur and pitch. Shadows from the lights criss-crossed on the floor. Among those present Margarita immediately recognized Azazello, now dressed in a tailcoat and standing at the head of the bed. The dressed-up Azazello no longer resembled that bandit in whose form he had appeared to Margarita in the Alexandrovsky Garden, and his bow to Margarita was very gallant. A naked witch, that same Hella who had so embarrassed the respectable barman of the Variety, and - alas - the same who had so fortunately been scared off by the cock on the night of the notorious s�ance, sat on a rug on the floor by the bed, stirring something in a pot which gave off a sulphurous steam. Besides these, there was also a huge black tom-cat in the room, sitting on a high tabouret before the chess table, holding a chess knight in his right paw.",test,2,2,0,seven golden claws burned thick wax candles table large chessboard pieces extraordinarily artful workmanship little low bench stood small shabby rug yet another table golden bowl another candelabrum branches form snakes room smelled sulphur pitch lights crisscrossed floor present immediately recognized dressed tailcoat standing head bed dressedup longer resembled bandit whose form appeared bow gallant naked witch embarrassed respectable barman alas fortunately scared cock night notorious s�ance sat rug floor bed stirring something pot gave sulphurous steam also huge black tomcat room sitting high tabouret chess table holding chess knight right paw
6152,"Hella rose and bowed to Margarita. The cat, jumping off the tabouret, did likewise. Scraping with his right hind paw, he dropped the knight and crawled under the bed after it. Margarita, sinking with fear, nevertheless made all this out by the perfidious candlelight. Her eyes were drawn to the bed, on which sat he whom, still quite recently, at the Patriarch's Ponds, poor Ivan had tried to convince that the devil does not exist. It was this non-existent one who was sitting on the bed. Two eyes were fixed on Margarita's face. The right one with a golden spark at its bottom, drilling anyone to the bottom of his soul, and the left one empty and black, like the narrow eye of a needle, like the entrance to the bottomless well of all darkness and shadow. Woland's face was twisted to one side, the right corner of the mouth drawn down, the high, bald forehead scored by deep wrinkles running parallel to the sharp eyebrows. The skin of Woland's face was as if burned for all eternity by the sun.",test,2,2,0,rose bowed cat jumping tabouret likewise right hind paw dropped knight crawled bed sinking fear nevertheless made perfidious candlelight eyes drawn bed sat still quite recently poor tried convince devil exist nonexistent one sitting bed eyes fixed face right one golden spark bottom drilling anyone bottom soul left one empty black like narrow eye needle like entrance bottomless well darkness shadow face twisted one side right corner mouth drawn high bald forehead scored deep wrinkles running parallel sharp eyebrows skin face burned eternity sun
6153,"Woland, broadly sprawled on the bed, was wearing nothing but a long nightshirt, dirty and patched on the left shoulder. One bare leg was tucked under him, the other was stretched out on the little bench. It was the knee of this dark leg that Hella was rubbing with some smoking ointment. Margarita also made out on Woland's bared, hairless chest a beetle artfully carved [2] from dark stone, on a gold chain and with some inscriptions on its back. Beside Woland, on a heavy stand, stood a strange globe, as if alive, lit on one side by the sun. The silence lasted a few seconds. 'He's studying me,' thought Margarita, and with an effort of will she tried to control the trembling in her legs. At last Woland began to speak, smiling, which made his sparkling eye as if to flare up. 'Greetings to you, Queen, and I beg you to excuse my homely attire.
